While tourists and business, partners in greed devour the fruit of the land. Starving and dying, assassins surround to kill them. Praying for something or someone to set them free.

Death squads are crawling the city, in search of the worthless to fill up mass graves. Corrupted and careless, degrading all life these cops are the killers, well-trained. Millions of people stand dead at their feet, begging for mercy denied. Breathing pollution and slaving to eat, they're humans, but empty inside. Rise, out of the slums, they seek to fight, fight to defend. Nothing is left but a future of death. Awaiting the poor, who starve just to breathe. Breathe in the air, now they shall be reborn. How can you think that our world is so good? The red, white and blue blinds your eyes. When everything's fine in your white neighborhood, who cares for the dying outside? Forced to rebellion, uprising they're tearing through the walls of confinement, uprooted The promise of a third world resistance, the power is overtaken. Nightfall in Sodom, it's burning.

He is said to have lived from 2375 to 2345 B.C., but some Egyptologists date him as far back as 5330 B.C. The internal structure of his pyramid is known for incorporating several innovative features, but is most recognized for the inclusion of vertical lines of hieroglyphs on the walls of the vestibule and burial chamber. When Maspero opened the Unas pyramid in 1881, he found texts covering these stone walls to be extremely difficult to decipher, because of their archais characters, forms, and spellings. These were magickal/religious texts, designed to ensure the safe passage of the Pharaoh into the next world. They are known today as the \\\"Pyramid Texts.\\\" According to these texts, Unas became great by eating the flesh of his mortal enemies and then slaying and devouring the gods themselves. Those gods that were old and worn out (Egyptian gods aged and died) were used as fuel for Unas's fire. After devouring the gods and absorbing their spirits and powers, Unas journeys through the day and night sky to become the star Sabu, or Orion. While this is certainly not the first reference to cannibalism in Old Kingdom texts, what is notable is the method by which the Pharaoh Unas achieves deification and immortality; by turning on the gods, slaying and then devouring them, and thus ascending to the heavens to become the star Orion. The concept was remarkable to Maspero, who found the idea to be of \\\"absolute savagery.\\\" Maspero seemed to be reeling from a confrontation with a symbolic revival of pre-dynastic cannibalistic rites - which are suggested, according to Maspero, by the gnamed and disconnected bones found in certain early graves. Professor Petrie suggests that at the original Sed festival, the tribal king appears to have been sacrificed and devoured, so that his people might derive from his flesh and blood the power and virtues which made him great. This practise was based on a belief in contagious magick. Bulls and boars were eaten to give men strength and courage, deer to give fleetness of foot, and serpents to give cunning. The blood of slain and wounded warriors was drunk so that their skill and bravery might be imparted t the drinkers. Similarly, Unas feasts after death on the spirits of the gods, and on the bodies of men and gods. He swallows their spirits, souls, and names, which are contained in their hearts, livers, and entrails, thus, Unas becomes allpowerful. In attempting to bring this epic-length text to song from, it was necessary to make some minor concessions, firstly, that every version I have at home of the text is translated somewhat differently, and thus there is not any singularly definitive versions; and secondly, that it would just not be possible to include every last line from the original text. That would probably necessitate a song inconceivable in length. As it is, in concise song lyric form, \\\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\\" weighs in at about 12 minutes plus - and that is using what would be considered only the bare minimum essential lines for the development and presentation of the main aspects of the text. For those interested in reading the entire work, there are several versions readily available online or by ordering from a local bookstore. I typed in \\\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\\" in a couple of search engines and was astounded at the number of results that came back.] \",\"Ashu Give us Power To Oppose this Legion of Shrikes They hath Defiled our Monuments and Graves For their Greed of Treasure Ashu Sehu Neferui Skhenn We Are the Breath of Horns Hot as the Desert Wind We are Slayers and Reapers of Men By the Arrow Shot from Lanata You will Fall to your Knees Dead or Begging Quarter Torn to Shreds by Obese Vultures Fossilized in the Desert Sand We are the Breath of Horns Hot as the Desert Wind We are the Slayers and Reapears of Men You will Never Escape This Valley Gallala Left to Decompose Forbidden the Underworld Bemused by Battle Lust I Gash your Throat And Splatter your Blood Upon the Altar of Bes We Erect one hundred Pyramids With your Severed Heads Ashu Sehu Neferui Skhenn [This song was inspired by a battle from a book caled River God by Wilbur Smith. The story takes place in the latter half of the 14th Dynasty, and is about a struggle to restore the majesty of the Pharaoh of Pharaohs. Tanus, leader of the mighties army of Egypt, the Blue Crocodile Regiment, hunted down and destroyed the Shrikes, a horrid nomadic tribe of thieves, rapists, and murderers that played the Egyptians. The title of the song, \\\"Wind of Horus,\\\" refers to the name of the boat of the Blue Crocodile Regiment. It is an enchantment of the god Horus to cause the wind to blow the Egyptians' sails in time of need. The repeated chant in the song is to invoke the god Ashu, who robs the enemies of the Egyptians of their virtues, weakening and destroying them. The word Lanata is mentioned in the song. Lanata was a bow made for Tanus by Taita the slave and was made of wood, ebony, rhinocerus horn, and ivory tusks. The bowstring was made out of the guts of a lion that Tanus had killed with his bronze-bladed war spear. Tanus was probably the only one in his army strong enough to use the Lanata bow. It had so much tension that he had to use a different technique just to pull the bowsting back. Tanus practised until he could shoot three arrows at a time piercing the heaviest of armor.] \",\"Sep Au Hetep Ab Au Mekhar Gau t Metkh Mekhar t Khhert Ua an Aqu Mekri Sau t Athien Hapti Tehem Er Sa Msa I Call Upon Thee My Father Amun for I am in the midst of A Multitude of Foes Abandoned by the Legions of Amun and Ra Engulfed by the Heat of the Fire Blood of the Impure Drips from my Weapons Dismembered armies Rot in the Sun Mekhi Kherit Au Aqu Mtum thai Peten Nekht An Aqu \",\"NaN\",\"Kheftin Asar Butbiu Enemies of Osiris Who Are To Be Burned Let There Be Fetters on Your Arms Let There Be Shackles on Your Necks Let There Be Chains Upon You Ye Shall Be Hacked to Pieces For What Ye Have Done To Osiris You Have Put His Mysteries Behind Your Backs You Hath Dragged the Statue of the God From The Secret Place You Hath Desecrated The Hidden Things of the Great One You Are Doomed To Stand And Receive in Your Faces The Fire Which Serpent Khetti Is About To Spit At You Khetti Great Serpent Who Lieth In Undulations Before the Damned Khetti Open Thy Mouth Distend Thy Jaws Belch Forth Thy Flames Against My Fathers Enemies Burn Up Their Bodies Consume their Souls By the Fire Which Issueth From Thy Mouth And By The Flames Which Art In Thy Body The Fire Which Is in the Serpent Khetti Shall Come Forth And Blaze Against The Enemies of Osiris Whosoever Knoweth How to Use These Words of Power Against the Serpent Shall Be As One Who Doth Not Enter Upon His Fiery Path [In the Book of Gates, another text describing the Egyptian underworld, within the Eighth Division of Night is the Gate of Set-Hra. The scenes depicted in this chapter describe some of the tortures which are inflicted upon the original enemies of Osiris. It is impossible for Osiris to slay all of his enemies at once, even though they are in his power. While various batches of them are awaiting their turn at the Block of Slaughter, they are kept tightly fettered and bound. One of the forms of the torture depicted described the \\\"Kheftin Asar Butchiu,\\\" i.e., the enemies of Osiris who are to be burned. Their arms are tied behind their backs in positions which cause intense pain, and they are doomed to stand and receive in their faces the fire which the serpent Khetti is about to spit at them, and then be hacked to pieaces and burnt. Horus commands the serpent Khetti, saying \\\"Open thy mouth! Distend thy jaws and belch forth thy flames against my father's enemies!

shape which were used to cast spells on the persons they depicted. Such objects survive to this day usually only when they are buried as a part of a rite, and usually in the vicinity of a tomb or necropolis. Archeologist have found the remains of such rites at the royal cemetaries of Giza, Saqqarra, Lisht, and at several forts in Nubia. Stone, wax, or mud figures, or broken clay tablets or clay pots, are inscribed with lists of the enemies of Egypt. The body of the figure is usually flattened to make room for the text, or sometimes a papyrus is inserted inside the body cavity. On the back, the arms, or the arms and legs, are bound together. The inscriptions found on them are called \\\"execration texts.\\\" These texts threaten death to specific people. Often, they include the name, parentage, and title of war. The execration texts were mainly aimed at enemy rulers, hostile nations, and tribes in Nubia, Libya, and Syria-Palestine. Magickal incantations and rites were used to cause death and suffering, and to prevent the angry spirits of the executed from taking vengeance on those who had condemned them. Usually included in these texts are long-standing enemies of those involved in the cursing rites. There is also often a catchball phrase against any man, woman, or eunuch who might be plotting rebellion. Amongst the common people, the execration rituals were carried out after the killing of a personal enemy or the execution of criminals. By killing the enemy's name, which was an integral part of the personality, this rite would extend the punishment into the afterlife. The spirits of defeated enemies or executed traitors were regarded as a continued supernatural threat, which needed to be met with magic. The wording of the texts is similar to that of contemporary spells on papyrus, which promise to protect against the malice of demons and ghosts. Those named in the execration texts are referred to as \\\"mut\\\" - the dangerous dead. It is also the word used to describe the troublesome dead in protective spells for private persons. The stone figures and red clay pots on which the execration texts were written were ritually broken as part of the cursing ceremony in order to smash the enemy's power. A pit near the Egyptian fort of Mirgissa in Nubia contained hundreds of such pot shards, as well as over 350 figures. Deposite of figures have been found outside fortresses, tombs, and funerary temples. The clay figures were burned and then buried with iron spikes driven through them, or nailed to the outer walls, as the bodies of executed traitors and foreign enemies sometimes were.
