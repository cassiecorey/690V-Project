    "Tasks:\n",
    "1. Read in (parse, tokenize, ...) the text (30 points)\n",
    "2. Visualize the text using different interactive Bokeh visualizations (10 points of each different type of interactive visualizations - max 30).\n",
    "3. Cluster the text and visualize using interactive Bokeh visualizations (10 points for each different type of interactive visualizations - max 30).\n",
    "4. Explain what you've seen (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our text mining and visualizations are based on the [Heavy Metal Text Mining](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/09/27/text-mining-pythonic-heavy-metal/) example. This example looks at multiple characteristics of the lyrics, some of which include: TFIDF, cosine distances between word distributions, emotional arcs, swearwords, and lyric generation. The characteristics were visualized using various scatter plots, graphs, and trees. A brief explanation of the algorithms used and the output observed is given separately for each visualization/technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "These can all be installed with `pip install <package>`\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- Sklearn\n",
    "- Textstat\n",
    "- Markovify\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gathering Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this example does not provide a dataset of lyrics, we collected lyrics ourselves by scraping [MetroLyrics](https://www.metrolyrics.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we chose a music genre: Tech Death Metal. We got our list of bands from [Wikipedia's list of Technical Death Metal Bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technical_death_metal_bands)."

He is said to have lived from 2375 to 2345 B.C., but some Egyptologists date him as far back as 5330 B.C. The internal structure of his pyramid is known for incorporating several innovative features, but is most recognized for the inclusion of vertical lines of hieroglyphs on the walls of the vestibule and burial chamber. When Maspero opened the Unas pyramid in 1881, he found texts covering these stone walls to be extremely difficult to decipher, because of their archais characters, forms, and spellings. These were magickal/religious texts, designed to ensure the safe passage of the Pharaoh into the next world. They are known today as the \\\"Pyramid Texts.\\\" According to these texts, Unas became great by eating the flesh of his mortal enemies and then slaying and devouring the gods themselves. Those gods that were old and worn out (Egyptian gods aged and died) were used as fuel for Unas's fire. After devouring the gods and absorbing their spirits and powers, Unas journeys through the day and night sky to become the star Sabu, or Orion. While this is certainly not the first reference to cannibalism in Old Kingdom texts, what is notable is the method by which the Pharaoh Unas achieves deification and immortality; by turning on the gods, slaying and then devouring them, and thus ascending to the heavens to become the star Orion. The concept was remarkable to Maspero, who found the idea to be of \\\"absolute savagery.\\\" Maspero seemed to be reeling from a confrontation with a symbolic revival of pre-dynastic cannibalistic rites - which are suggested, according to Maspero, by the gnamed and disconnected bones found in certain early graves. Professor Petrie suggests that at the original Sed festival, the tribal king appears to have been sacrificed and devoured, so that his people might derive from his flesh and blood the power and virtues which made him great. This practise was based on a belief in contagious magick. Bulls and boars were eaten to give men strength and courage, deer to give fleetness of foot, and serpents to give cunning. The blood of slain and wounded warriors was drunk so that their skill and bravery might be imparted t the drinkers. Similarly, Unas feasts after death on the spirits of the gods, and on the bodies of men and gods. He swallows their spirits, souls, and names, which are contained in their hearts, livers, and entrails, thus, Unas becomes allpowerful. In attempting to bring this epic-length text to song from, it was necessary to make some minor concessions, firstly, that every version I have at home of the text is translated somewhat differently, and thus there is not any singularly definitive versions; and secondly, that it would just not be possible to include every last line from the original text. That would probably necessitate a song inconceivable in length. As it is, in concise song lyric form, \\\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\\" weighs in at about 12 minutes plus - and that is using what would be considered only the bare minimum essential lines for the development and presentation of the main aspects of the text. For those interested in reading the entire work, there are several versions readily available online or by ordering from a local bookstore. I typed in \\\"Unas Slayer of the Gods\\\" in a couple of search engines and was astounded at the number of results that came back.] \",\"Ashu Give us Power To Oppose this Legion of Shrikes They hath Defiled our Monuments and Graves For their Greed of Treasure Ashu Sehu Neferui Skhenn We Are the Breath of Horns Hot as the Desert Wind We are Slayers and Reapers of Men By the Arrow Shot from Lanata You will Fall to your Knees Dead or Begging Quarter Torn to Shreds by Obese Vultures Fossilized in the Desert Sand We are the Breath of Horns Hot as the Desert Wind We are the Slayers and Reapears of Men You will Never Escape This Valley Gallala Left to Decompose Forbidden the Underworld Bemused by Battle Lust I Gash your Throat And Splatter your Blood Upon the Altar of Bes We Erect one hundred Pyramids With your Severed Heads Ashu Sehu Neferui Skhenn [This song was inspired by a battle from a book caled River God by Wilbur Smith. The story takes place in the latter half of the 14th Dynasty, and is about a struggle to restore the majesty of the Pharaoh of Pharaohs. Tanus, leader of the mighties army of Egypt, the Blue Crocodile Regiment, hunted down and destroyed the Shrikes, a horrid nomadic tribe of thieves, rapists, and murderers that played the Egyptians. The title of the song, \\\"Wind of Horus,\\\" refers to the name of the boat of the Blue Crocodile Regiment. It is an enchantment of the god Horus to cause the wind to blow the Egyptians' sails in time of need. The repeated chant in the song is to invoke the god Ashu, who robs the enemies of the Egyptians of their virtues, weakening and destroying them. The word Lanata is mentioned in the song. Lanata was a bow made for Tanus by Taita the slave and was made of wood, ebony, rhinocerus horn, and ivory tusks. The bowstring was made out of the guts of a lion that Tanus had killed with his bronze-bladed war spear. Tanus was probably the only one in his army strong enough to use the Lanata bow. It had so much tension that he had to use a different technique just to pull the bowsting back. Tanus practised until he could shoot three arrows at a time piercing the heaviest of armor.] \",\"Sep Au Hetep Ab Au Mekhar Gau t Metkh Mekhar t Khhert Ua an Aqu Mekri Sau t Athien Hapti Tehem Er Sa Msa I Call Upon Thee My Father Amun for I am in the midst of A Multitude of Foes Abandoned by the Legions of Amun and Ra Engulfed by the Heat of the Fire Blood of the Impure Drips from my Weapons Dismembered armies Rot in the Sun Mekhi Kherit Au Aqu Mtum thai Peten Nekht An Aqu \",\"NaN\",\"Kheftin Asar Butbiu Enemies of Osiris Who Are To Be Burned Let There Be Fetters on Your Arms Let There Be Shackles on Your Necks Let There Be Chains Upon You Ye Shall Be Hacked to Pieces For What Ye Have Done To Osiris You Have Put His Mysteries Behind Your Backs You Hath Dragged the Statue of the God From The Secret Place You Hath Desecrated The Hidden Things of the Great One You Are Doomed To Stand And Receive in Your Faces The Fire Which Serpent Khetti Is About To Spit At You Khetti Great Serpent Who Lieth In Undulations Before the Damned Khetti Open Thy Mouth Distend Thy Jaws Belch Forth Thy Flames Against My Fathers Enemies Burn Up Their Bodies Consume their Souls By the Fire Which Issueth From Thy Mouth And By The Flames Which Art In Thy Body The Fire Which Is in the Serpent Khetti Shall Come Forth And Blaze Against The Enemies of Osiris Whosoever Knoweth How to Use These Words of Power Against the Serpent Shall Be As One Who Doth Not Enter Upon His Fiery Path [In the Book of Gates, another text describing the Egyptian underworld, within the Eighth Division of Night is the Gate of Set-Hra. The scenes depicted in this chapter describe some of the tortures which are inflicted upon the original enemies of Osiris. It is impossible for Osiris to slay all of his enemies at once, even though they are in his power. While various batches of them are awaiting their turn at the Block of Slaughter, they are kept tightly fettered and bound. One of the forms of the torture depicted described the \\\"Kheftin Asar Butchiu,\\\" i.e., the enemies of Osiris who are to be burned. Their arms are tied behind their backs in positions which cause intense pain, and they are doomed to stand and receive in their faces the fire which the serpent Khetti is about to spit at them, and then be hacked to pieaces and burnt. Horus commands the serpent Khetti, saying \\\"Open thy mouth! Distend thy jaws and belch forth thy flames against my father's enemies!

Cursed Thy Name Is Crushed Thine Clay is Smashed And Broken Thy Vengeance Against The Living Shall Come to Naught [Among the most sinister objects from the ancient world are the figurines in human shape which were used to cast spells on the persons they depicted. Such objects survive to this day usually only when they are buried as a part of a rite, and usually in the vicinity of a tomb or necropolis. Archeologist have found the remains of such rites at the royal cemetaries of Giza, Saqqarra, Lisht, and at several forts in Nubia. Stone, wax, or mud figures, or broken clay tablets or clay pots, are inscribed with lists of the enemies of Egypt. The body of the figure is usually flattened to make room for the text, or sometimes a papyrus is inserted inside the body cavity. On the back, the arms, or the arms and legs, are bound together. The inscriptions found on them are called \\\"execration texts.\\\" These texts threaten death to specific people. Often, they include the name, parentage, and title of war. The execration texts were mainly aimed at enemy rulers, hostile nations, and tribes in Nubia, Libya, and Syria-Palestine. Magickal incantations and rites were used to cause death and suffering, and to prevent the angry spirits of the executed from taking vengeance on those who had condemned them. Usually included in these texts are long-standing enemies of those involved in the cursing rites. There is also often a catchball phrase against any man, woman, or eunuch who might be plotting rebellion. Amongst the common people, the execration rituals were carried out after the killing of a personal enemy or the execution of criminals. By killing the enemy's name, which was an integral part of the personality, this rite would extend the punishment into the afterlife. The spirits of defeated enemies or executed traitors were regarded as a continued supernatural threat, which needed to be met with magic. The wording of the texts is similar to that of contemporary spells on papyrus, which promise to protect against the malice of demons and ghosts. Those named in the execration texts are referred to as \\\"mut\\\" - the dangerous dead. It is also the word used to describe the troublesome dead in protective spells for private persons. The stone figures and red clay pots on which the execration texts were written were ritually broken as part of the cursing ceremony in order to smash the enemy's power. A pit near the Egyptian fort of Mirgissa in Nubia contained hundreds of such pot shards, as well as over 350 figures. Deposite of figures have been found outside fortresses, tombs, and funerary temples. The clay figures were burned and then buried with iron spikes driven through them, or nailed to the outer walls, as the bodies of executed traitors and foreign enemies sometimes were. The more eloborate enemy figures were sometimes trussed up like animals about to be sacrificed. Some are shown with their throats cut, the method used to kill sacrificial animals. The dismembered body of a Nubian and a flint sacrificial knife were found nar the Mirgissa pit. Some Egyptologists believe that human sacrifices routinely accompanied execration rituals, while others have argued that the figures were normally a substitute for such sacrifices.] \",\"Ia Namtaru Ia Lammia Ia Asaku Ia Pazuzu Ia Zixul zi Azkak Ia Gula zi Pazu Alal uggae Utukku Xul Ia Ia Pazuzu Ia Ningursu Ia Ia Umduggu Shemti Shebui Nehenkau Addu Nergal Arrallu Nergal dread God of War and Plague Avenge the shades of our Fallen ones Blacken the sun with Fierce Winds Bring forth your Terrible Storms!

Suddenly he realised, there was something wrong, he then desired, to take off the mask, but then to his horror, it stuck to the face, now it was his new skin, he could never change. Then he knew, that the wizard had tricked him, he had traded, hatred for fear, now he would pay, for his selfish biddings, all he wanted, was people to care. He would have traded all his riches just to be liked. Now he will be ignored and feared for the rest of his life. \",\"Using universal time theories to ratify their religion.

Only their sanctuary shall profit as they understand, the true purpose of life: To become a god, to become omnipotent - This is life's work, yet completion will be fatal. Psychologically unbalanced leaders in knowledge, Unwittingly preparing the termination of 'reality'. Yet with no malevolence towards others of their kindred... Simply focusing on the will of the sermon. Time movement is their goal such dedication rarely witnessed! The only motivation in their myopic minds an individual craving for a subconscious need, Allows philosophical faults to be unseen thus far created revolutionary scientific: And technical advancements that that would be the awe of all. Their concealment from society however, masks such glory, Playing fundamentalist cult like spiritual insanity. The word of their messiah eludes to their intentions yet she is no more than, A charismatic jester of the modern world. Emittfihs her synonym - The name of true insanity time must be unbalanced to reach true enlightenment For it is a cage that enslaves us all. Restricted in thought we are not. For we seek what others only dream, Try as they might, those un-enlightened will not understand The secrets and power that await in the shifting of time we must strive against ill-informed resistance To acquire the chalice of a higher spiritual awakening! Time must be stopped to achieve their purpose; A crazed thought. Impossible of course? Yet their methods could be plausible if their timeline theories are correct, This 'cult' could succeed in reversing reality itself, Cataclysmic events beyond mental, comprehension. Reversing the evolution of that universe itself! Using, advanced quantum physics and light frequency radiation to achieve the task. Accidentally covering the mysteries of time, but believing it to be true celestial intervention. Theories, when, exercised, will follow a destructive path. Transgressing timelines and interfering in matters of dimensional construct... The Objective: To find the dawn of time itself and prevent it from commencing! Only then will they reach. Their goal...

Joyous with the knowledge that their appeal had been answered. These visitors - describing themselves as celestial gatherers, traders, explorers. A half truth. Masking the deception beneath. Offering answers... Knowledge and Truth... But at a price, A fair exchange... They requested life... Aghast... Apprehensive... The forefathers refused. Negotiating; the travellers explained that it would not be their lives; Not those of the present era. It Would be the future populous: An age away: An age beyond imagination... Our age. Nervously an agreement was made. The celestial ones prepared to reveal their knowledge with the select few to do with as they saw fit. The chosen, schooled by the visitors from the sky not foreseeing the knowledge that lag ahead Not foreseeing the knowledge they would learn... Unable to be purged from their mind... Irreversible. Departing, the travellers were seen no more. The selected were left with knowledge unimaginable. Disturbed, overwhelmed - no choice but to cease their own existence. Their lives had become futile, with their infinite comprehension. Lives forfeit by their own trembling hands. Blood spilled instead of answers... Long forgotten... Unaware that we must uphold this pact... A deal that exists despite the weakest of principals They will fulfil a bizarre religious crusade. We belong to the celestial ones: The harvesters of the foolish... Traders and gatherers they are: cunning in their methods. Exchanging what is required fur their spiritual needs our lives... Any life unworthy... Must be halted. Sustaining their faith. The unworthy are those who mishandle true insight. Betraying their future our planet, placed in total stasis... With no meaningful continuation. Like countless before, and endless to come. This is how it will continue... To save their own being. Giving a function, a purpose to their all-knowing lives. This is their belief... to weed out the feeble in the cosmos Those who do not learn should not progress... Those without understanding should not continue... \",\"Another un-replenishing slumber...

To mend all that is flawed Cultivated in clandestine, groomed for the chores that lay ahead. It is a noble pursuit to heal the sick... Yet not of an ailment they would desire to keep Their own singularity... Left without guidance to pave a now disordered path. Minds scatted by the pursuit of absolute perfection, Moulded by the environment in which was so pure.

One color of earth shimmering with different shades Shapeless shadows independent of the light Kneeling n the ruins of sacred towns Crying on ashes of refuted truth We shall remain and dream again And moment of awakening is too short to recognize \",\"Sodium sunrise burns my eyes Electric charged reanimation I must recombine my (scattered) mind After techno-crucifixion Growling engines/transmitting praise Audio sensors detecting waves The factory/reanimates me As a post organic form of life Vacuum breath on the surface Of my positron skin Covered by the barbed wire And life-proof membrane I'm the factory's newest product Son of serialized destruction Perfect body - perfect soul Reborn as a post organic form of life Oxygen - no longer needed Brain - lobotomized Heart - pumping cyanide Arms - mechanized Eyes - throwing x-rays Tissues - mummified Erased - my memory All the rest is vaporized Baptized in a lake of acid tears I am resurrected in toxic soil Hardware body - software soul In post organic form/appeared I've seen the android god preaching Radiating his nuclear love I've seen the world around Bewitched in a pill of mescaline \",\" I love you Satan, my father, my pride You showed me the right things to do Reject the poison of god I open myself for you I can feel you inside me I can feel you inside my veins You are the energy I need You make me strong... INHUMAN Bow your head for Satan Bow your head for Satan I am in you You are in me, we are together You are my paradise, my everything You are my hell when I need it You are my heaven I will always love you FOREVER Bow your heads for Satan Bow your heads for Satan You are my paradise I need you in my life I am trapped inside your flames Love that never dies Bow your heads, Bow your head For satan Bow your heads, Bow your head My soul Belongs to you Forever there with you My body belongs to you And you will feast upon it too Bow your heads, Bow your head For satan Bow your heads, Bow your head Together hand in hand We destroy the ones we hate Our enemies will fall Dead bodies we will rape \",\"[Music: Z.
