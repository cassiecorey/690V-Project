    "Our text mining and visualizations are based on the [Heavy Metal Text Mining](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/09/27/text-mining-pythonic-heavy-metal/) example. This example looks at multiple characteristics of the lyrics, some of which include: TFIDF, cosine distances between word distributions, emotional arcs, swearwords, and lyric generation. The characteristics were visualized using various scatter plots, graphs, and trees. A brief explanation of the algorithms used and the output observed is given separately for each visualization/technique.\n",

    "We did our analyis on a dataset of tech death metal lyrics gathered from various websites. Because it was gathered by hand, the dataset needed to be cleaned. We mainly used Bokeh and sklearn to visualize different properties of the lyrics and how they differ for each tech death artist. These visualizations required calculating several metrics on the dataset including complexity, tfidf, and others. Through our examinations we found that there is a lot of variety even in one small sub-genre of metal. There is a wide variety of lyric complexities and use of swear words. In addition, most of the artist's tfidf vectors are very far from those of other artists meaning each really does have their own unique style.\n",
