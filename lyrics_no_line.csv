0,gojira,flying whales,"At the very first sound There was just light And then, a storm Of time and space Just came and struck Created our time In water life We understand It just only began  Forced to look to the sky And wonder why We cannot face the fact that We're all scared now Of mysteries of life There is a mask that soon will fall Before the strong embrace Of love and might Of light in the dark I go for a quest I have to give myself the answer Enter now this place in the wild I can see the glade My feeling now is growing bigger  From the sky From the sky  I do feel like no one can save me I am so alone and yet I cried I called for help, forsaken But now I know The only way is to Understand the living Obey the rule of light And face the fear Inside out!  Lost, I found there a stone Erected in line With one the brightest stars Of all the night sky vault And I took my time Took off the moss Washed away the dust And gave a new lease of life Its' mystical force I grab it now And praise this lord Of earth and stone Make passage for souls awaken So it returns To where it's always been With the gods Now coming, I feel the love It comes from on high  I know the words But now I feel it inside It grows, it's there And all it comes From the sky From the sky"

11,gojira,pain is a master,"Crawling and moaning in the sharp blade of grass All my life starting over, blood spilled inside out I went through this cycle of pain deep in myself Destroyed by awful hands, a demon of illusion The pain now awaken, I'm cracking wide open Can barely recognize my body, a battlefield Unquestioned pride once so fragile I cannot even recall names or faces Those standing on my side Those standing on my side, always My side I am nothing, the pain awake is forging me Face down, inert Forcing me, dreams haunting me I am immense, I am awake, renewed Lost in the darkest time I know I felt their presence Even if I was blind, face down I was blind Pain, please forgive my ignorance My master "
12,gojira,born in winter,"before all things reborn again you learn the painful breath of time cold morning stretches out your arms to the mighty warmth of one golden sun seems all have gone insane for gold all was created out of the night we're all born from the burst of a star the day you'll come to life you'll realize expanding force of life where you belong and in the winter cold, with opened eyes you'll find the strength to fight and stand upright one day you'll walk the world and keep in mind the heart you've been given in winter time and through the bitter cold, with opened eyes you'll find the strength to fight and stand upright "
13,gojira,the cell,"All this evil, sanctified You're not alone You're not the only one Overcrowded in your brain You'll find a way out, or you will fall! Get me out of here I've been lost in the dark Get me out of here I'm locked inside me No control over anything I'm dying to learn I'm dying to forget Overcrowded in my mind I have to let it go, now Get me out of here I've been lost in the dark Get me out of here No Overcrowded in our minds We'll find a way out, right now Now! Now! Now! Lyrics from oficial booklet (from CD) "
14,gojira,global warming,"Four hundred thousand years ago They came from outer space And gave us life here And we are just taking everything for granted I don't think we should do this now And when I see the smoke around I feel like I'm not from Humankind down there I feel like glaciers are my eyes And mountains are my head My heart is ocean And I feel all alone Cause everybody is wrong I fear the living What is this thing that we call hate And that's inside of me Get out of here!  A world is down And none can rebuild it Disabled lands are evolving My eyes are shut, a vision is dying My head explodes And I fall in disgrace  I hold my inner child within And tell him not to cry ""Don't fear the living"" One day you will stand as a king And no fear can erase This light below us Each one of us is now engaged This secret we all have This truth is growing And as a warrior I have to fight I can already feel The love I'll discover  I had this dream, our planet surviving The guiding stars always glowing And all the wealths The fates of the countries They're all rebuilding at the same time I never fell and always believed it We could evolve and get older Open thy eyes and let all this flow in Now see a new hope is growing inside  We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing"

16,gojira,planned obsolescence,"Created weakness for the number on the board Absurd amount of things, obsolete creation The lust for always more, indulgence is hunger A greed of power, the demon needs to feed From cradle you've been taught how to rule and conquer The devil smiling, not this isn't real Black vultures in the mist approaching, now closer The end is coming, we'll take it from there A message goes to all the souls To all those staying, face turned to the ground You hold the key to infinite power That has always been here and forever Every time you step out, raise your voice Resurrected from the ground Designed for failure Behold of the waste is burnt to the ground Face down and broken We dedicate our essence to this game No better, time, let's dream on, wish for better You're on an elevated sense of greater These engines, power crushing down One day we'll wake up from this absolute nonsense A star long worshiped will burn in the red Disused and empty shell, icon of an old world Conscience awakened, we'll take it from there "
17,gojira,only pain,"Since day one you try your best To get what you need the most The solution is you, becoming a god Only pain, all in vain The day you get to the point All illusions are lost The problem is you, becoming so cold Just wanted to be good Just wanted to be gold Just wanted to be god Just wanted to be ... Only pain, all in vain Take all, fear none Wake up, go strong I'm the lamb It's just another offering I reclaim the might and power Cast away long before dawn In a cage left to rot Creature fierce, tamed, is dying Lost the feel for all I've loved It's too strong I'm going down "
18,gojira,toxic garbage island,"Mysterious form, soul in the dark under this heavy sealing concrete waves Followed by servants, funeral cortege this pale ghost is gathering his strength Ghost, pale, the procession is crawling Plastic form dead things it is now so clear How could I fail to understand Cities are burning the trees are dying My heart awake but still pain is killing me Pain is killing me Take this pestilent destruction out of my way The great pacific garbage patch is exhausting And the world is sliding away in a vortex of floating refuse With the sacred one you have lost Plastic bag in the sea Plastic bag in the sea Plastic bag in the sea Plastic bag in the sea "
19,gojira,the gift of guilt,"We leave the shores to see the mountains rising A distant impression growing This judgment creates the pain we hold Destructive intentions that serve no purpose But the end of us all These vultures from the past, coming In all the hells and worlds, the time has come Delivered from their eyes Embrace, suffer, destroy - the gift of guilt The shame and sorrow, self-condemnation Fell all the gaps and the spaces, unyielding Bestowed upon us, devastating power We're building connective tissue to a maze of lies We're left as starving orphans The vital core is gone Our sins are all over and over again we swallow We're sick and tired when this wind blows The reflex is insane We must forgive and stop blaming ourselves for this love These vultures from the past, coming In all the hells and worlds, the time has come Delivered from their eyes I'm leaving this behind - the gift of guilt "
20,gojira,the heaviest matter of the universe,"Lay down fall away Lie awake Just cannot move My arms and legs I'm paralyzed Don't recall how to free Myself from this In the heart of the dark My face contorted Don't know how to reach the light But I feel so bad Like a freak in a cage Open the door Enter your heart You go so far Golden unworldly silence Space flight at speed of light I cross the clouds and colors The black hole is calling me I slide on the horizon On the frontier not to cross Black dwarf Time's gone distorted In the heart of the dark A whirl of light Enter in The realm of nothingness I feel the cold, my eyes are shut My fear is slowly dying Light years from here Are my thoughts and cages I can hear their moan But now a long deep breath Is calling Overtaking time And now understanding space I feel united I do cross light Feel the living Here in the center Stands the light of love That never can be touched From greater silence Shall return "
21,gojira,the shooting star,"On the first light of the day you march on Departure has arrived, don't look back Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight Until you feel the blast of a shooting star Following the spark like a rocket in the sky Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close Headed north, frozen land, where tigers go to die Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out You are higher In the sky Learn the skill to stay alive, survival The city is so mean, you're being watched Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt Until the light calls you back into the wild When you get to the other side please send a sign It'll fly through the atmosphere in time And if you hold the truth within your hands You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn Everlasting love is ever-growing Hang on to what you have and let it grow Everlasting love is ever-dying It's in the past, you have to let it go "
22,gojira,liberation,(instrumental) 
23,gojira,ocean planet,"I'm in a mental cage I'm locked up Imprisoned I live Deathlike, sickening Strong is your hold On my resignation I don't see the stars My memories are veiled  In fluid dreams I fall I'm restless Walls made of stone Are turned into water now Enlightened demons Are taking me by the hand Approaching me This great eye speaking  Mountainous waves Are breaking on my despair Awaken me but I'm still dreaming And I just plunge Into this sea of light Set open the doors of soul I'm living  Lightning struck me I see the path I was so scared of And fly to the stars Conviction now increasing at last My skin is broken I see the smallest part of me My mind is alive But I'll never bow to this again  Why do they call me there How can I fly All this water I don't feel like I could ever swim to them Whales in the sky I feel they're so close Inside, and yet so far away  Burst into tears, I feel sad My dreams aflame The force is now Lie on a stone Drop this load and try to see The ocean planet is on burn"
24,gojira,satan is a lawyer,"Lawyer talks, he's so correct, he is respect He learned how to make you feel safe and kill you with a smile And the food so fast, the hair so clean The moon so far, fire so weak All those words flying in the air Cannot see the stars Images, colors, like wrong perfection Wash my brain, dirty it's so clean But who are you? The mixture has no smell Soon you will sit on the bench of those who deny I have my soul You sell a dream you create Condemned by what you condemned before Smooth are the words you sing down and high Underground is your joy your laws Satan is a lawyer You choose the appeerance of the futile Trapped, a coner stops your back, you're out Before you grow you will die... "
25,gojira,esoteric surgery,"You have the power to heal yourself All illness can be healed the cell regenerates disambiguated situation There is a secret code in the structure of the mind You have the power to heal yourself Flesh bodies mute and blinded roaming uncertain, lost infected misinformed Releasing a black enormous insect out from the chest archaic form disease Esoteric surgery a dissection of the soul Unsuspected precise power on the wounded astral body projected beam of light All illness can be healed the cell regenerates disambiguated situation There is a secret code in the structure of the mind You have the power to heal yourself Suspended floating in empty spaces Descending swift like a fire running down Obstruction disintegration life force overcoming all circumstances Release the pain "
26,gojira,from the sky,"At the very first sound There was just light And then, a storm Of time and space Just came and struck Created our time In water life We understand It just only began  Forced to look to the sky And wonder why We cannot face the fact that We're all scared now Of mysteries of life There is a mask that soon will fall Before the strong embrace Of love and might Of light in the dark I go for a quest I have to give myself the answer Enter now this place in the wild I can see the glade My feeling now is growing bigger  From the sky From the sky  I do feel like no one can save me I am so alone and yet I cried I called for help, forsaken But now I know The only way is to Understand the living Obey the rule of light And face the fear Inside out!  Lost, I found there a stone Erected in line With one the brightest stars Of all the night sky vault And I took my time Took off the moss Washed away the dust And gave a new lease of life Its' mystical force I grab it now And praise this lord Of earth and stone Make passage for souls awaken So it returns To where it's always been With the gods Now coming, I feel the love It comes from on high  I know the words But now I feel it inside It grows, it's there And all it comes From the sky From the sky"
27,gojira,1990 quatrillions de tonnes,
28,gojira,magma,"Analyse this chemistry Producing poison And creeping in you veins For the love of blood The poison slowly spreads Through the body and the mind Close your eyes and drop your things Be ready to fly You are now, high In the sun, burn You're away, alive On the moon, round After walking all the miles Consumed into your bones And breathing all the dust Of the desert land I know that all long You were doing it for absolution It's written in you eyes You are now, high In the sun, burn You're away, alive On the moon, round Away Just want to fly away, always higher Away Embrace the light on the other side "
29,gojira,the axe,"I've been a victim to the blade against myself Bloodletting all of my soul Sucked in, paralyzed in this vortex Reduced to the silence In the dark Ive lingered too long This sharpened axe, beam of light I reach for and I master Wield against these shadows Its purpose now revealed in silence Keep searching, question if this light ends Now I will strike and dig with precision Introspective eye, erase the concept I lost my fears and the notion of time I healed my sorrow All boundaries are illusion When you reach the center light And reinforce the striking power By chance you're followed Its purpose now revealed in silence Keep searching, question if this light ends All ghosts dwelling in, inside, in the heart I see them all, release their shadow "
30,gojira,liquid fire,"Ejected from the womb, unrestrained, I'm catching the wind Unfolded fire blows with the words, straight from within The second I was born I found a shelter deep in my own I ventured further out on the edge of the glacier This is how we talk to the world Pure liquid fire running through our veins We're in this alone, we bow to no one Carved by the waves, our sacred temple Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone This is no fiction, we've come to an end now Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight Intelligence of the heart as only guidance Infinite power lies all around us and in the heart The flashes find a way, stealing through these broken walls And when this fire grows, it does it so we can remember The meaning of this life, we'll be marching until the end Had no taste for more lies, we are standing alone The bright treasure we found has no price and no name In the light of this star, with the forces aligned This is how we talk to the world Pure liquid fire running through our veins We're in this alone, we bow to no one Carved by the waves, our sacred temple Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone This is no fiction, We've come to an end now Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight Intelligence of the heart as only guidance "
31,gojira,mouth of kala,"There's a river of time Let us worship this god of destruction On nothing we can reply All is gone, belong to the past You should learn by the time Everything changing over and over We're all falling so fast Keep on burning Overwhelming power Keep on burning, change The old me didn't survive Inexorable transfiguration There is something at war The red tainted flash on the wall I'm nowhere to be found Nothing matters, truth out of sight In the air I dissolve I'm fading away Overwhelming power Keep on burning, change "
32,gojira,the wild healer,INSTRUMENTAL 
33,gojira,the way of all flesh,"Anything that has a shape will crumble away, disappear We belong to the circle life of all creation We crawl and deny ourselves, refuse this evidence that we project our greatest fears on death and forget our power I want to live my life in close touch with the sacred Pacify the disturbances of the mind I face my own death Lower and lower is the pressure, I can feel the parts of me collapsing one into the other Higher state of consciousness awaken, I can see the light of this next world Leading my soul reborn I find it hard to believe that this picture on the wall is everything I do understand all the prayers, life is so sharp and hurts so bad What does it mean to be dying, what if you take the guts and brain away Is it this blood and heartbeat that you call life Every effort to ignore it is unavailing we all have to die Is it too late to dull the edges of the pain, I have to try This is an other dimension You can scatter ashes to the winds and even buried in the ground I'm still here Do not be afraid you are dying and the four great elements of your body are collapsing one into the other It feels as if you are being crushed by mountains The light of this world has faded completely But the light of the next world have not yet appeared Your breath is now still, no warmth to your skin Do not be afraid, there's no way that you can stay here You are leaving this world All lights are fading away now Leave behind the loved ones and all you know Do not be afraid and let yourself go "
34,gojira,embrace the world,"I sit on a rock cannot be touched by struggle & confusion I reclaim my space inside my structure look at this point all is about nothing, everything comes near the remotest parts of the world by silence we can dissolve disruptive vibrations I have to try Ga√Øa's alive for good under my feet the forest over me the largest It's roundness I feel Lifelong misery How do we get to Avalon? There is a bridge beyond indestructible the earth is a temple I cannot see what is wrong and All gods are one I close my eyes I'm all around, I feel so present embracing it's vastness I hold facing the world I become a part of it I'm not alone anymore I embrace the world "
35,gojira,blow me away you niverse,"Reverse, blow me in that black hole down there Return through perfect circle of my retina No Gravity Watch Out! Hang Out! Fuck Off! Beyond! Out Yonder! Upsidedown I bleed on you so ease my pain, Blow Me Away You! Smash Up! wash away the blood from my body I see this halo of dust all around But my vision is clear I know I don't have any forces left To go the distance La dame des fauves I defy you, Artemis Shoot me between the eyes I want to face the day of reckoning Reunite, I want to embrace your light Implode, explode, both at the same time Destruction, let me disappear, fill my empty, Go to venus ('s) "
36,gojira,where dragons dwell,A deep voice is rising From the heart of the mountain Vibrations of the stone I can hear in my heart The call of instinct The flight of the powerful I hunger for it It just keeps me alive I met the dragon In a cave by the mountain Now I bring the evidence The beast is alive This ageless army Will strike in the morning And then a star will rise And shine in the sky But I grow impatient Cannot stand the wait And I start to dig Within me This tunnel to I In this region of me A great dragon is lying On the wealth of a mighty world My own world inside I saw I saw monsters And I And I started to dig within When I When I turn my back on them They devour me In this region of me A dragon is lying there Awake Monster Monsters kings Do not scorn them But do not fear them Muster Muster thy army Dragons are the myth alive In the heart of men 
37,gojira,remembrance,"I feel I come from better conditions buried deep in my mind I forgot awake my soul I want to find and drink this light Images of the past other lives and other places always the same embraces I return to where I've been I take inside a forward movement Involved in desire of consciousness progress, understand I want to find the keys of the past remember the past present future memory is a force so many things have happened to me the hardest of all But the gates would never again be opened to me unless I could bid them open at my own will and command I feel I come from better conditions (opened them at my own will and command) buried deep in my mind I forgot (opened them at my own will and command) always the same light, same embraces (opened them at my own will and command) I take inside a forward movement "
38,gojira,adoration for none,Everyone is doing their best to destroy it Simplicity's forgotten And we all drill the ground I stand free I refuse to be surrounded The stones and dust bite hostile devours flesh and bone The weakest lost in hatred Consequence is upon my door Responsible for my own life I'm reborn again and again Driven to increase my own power by creation the purest choice Destined to rule my life and go the way of the flesh Nature is my only master I will bow to no one The ground is dry like rock without any hope left But now I decide to grab my life with my hands Crave for freedom build my own life Adoration for none Reaction is a weakness the strong cannot afford My path is not determined by actions of others They fill themselves with hate Covering their faces blackened the wolves are back and crave to kill Slip on stones and break their legs Try to hide from termination But the time has come You will have to pay the debt of nature And now you are the one To change the face of the world You wield the sword the pain is left aside And I have left my tears behind me So I refind the way I that I know So bright to me And I only adore the fact that we are the creators of our own lives Lust for power is the master disease of our time This force alone devours the weak and rules the strongest So mired in convolution It chokes the life from your throat Break the chains of complication I breathe the air of freedom There is no room for your judgment My life is mine alone I purge myself of resentment I breathe the air of freedom Breathe... 
39,gojira,all the tears,"Are we left all alone? Mother has no time but she cares for me and she cried all the tears I am joining now the river flow I am three days old Now the time has come You have to be man I don't want to destroy the only chance I have to survive down here The wind blows I'm so scared and the waves so big, I'm not prepared I will have to be strong but for now I cry all the tears Now enter the storm and feel electric sword My entire life is about to burn I am struggling, life is illusion But I keep the dream of a better time This secret knowledge I receive from where I am So precious the treasured icons Extended to this point Forget the ones that hurt They all want, they struggle They fight and try to dry their tears We are all left on our own We are bound yet by each others lives Now I'm leaving this world I will never forget the river flow The pains and traps of life I put my scars away and love I have to face the truth of living I left my boat behind I am not taking it Where I go I won't be crying I die "
40,gojira,to sirius,"Now from a solar system To another I fly I come with life in my veins Through darkened space I ran I left a struggle behind And faced the fear that's alive I lost a world and traveled Straight across from the sky To find the gates of the heart  I come to Sirius C To learn from you friends of old And wish to come into being And behold I'm with you I am ready now to go The distance and even beyond Recover all my forces All the strength of the world And feel the light into me  From the strength of God We go to the power of Goddess This place is a throne For brightness The age of war is over  For God's sake They have never heard of you ""You'll never reach This master race"" Our force sickening Killing all the time Human laws Already slayed many lives  There was a streak of madness But now I know I see it's not the only truth The scars in me are opened Won't you please call me beyond  Crave affection love and courage Being courageous And flying instead of Falling down Follow these instructions I've been given In this dream awake  There is no goal to reach now Leviathans No complaint at all Dolphins from upper space Are in front of me In present they dwell  This is my way I've found my home My state of real There is no goal to reach This is my way"

42,gojira,on the bota,"Lost, a lion came and said: ""Come, on the brink of the abyss"" Watch my feet swinging in the great empty one Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades c'etait un palais infini No one else is able now to play with the answers And I open, my mind is so clear There's a door in the wall of time... "
43,gojira,wisdom comes,he who learns must suffer and even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart and in our own despair against our will comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of god ease your pain i cannot with suffering i don't he who learns must suffer and even in our sleep pain falls drop by drop upon the heart against our will wisdom comes 
44,gojira,clone,"Clone Every Step you take is to the end Chaos, duplicate the human slaves Mother Nature so far away: Why? Perfect is the race you dream Right now, I make my choice Perfection you fake is not The soul, not a genetic code You fools, you ignoramuses Hatchery, the newborn to celebrate Ashes to ashes, I see respect in the dust Life is so perfect Now for the weak an abortion Celebrate perfection that grows The flesh, a gift of science The soul a fault of a god Life on its way to the state of fire From the cold taste of steel Light embraces the dark, lava flowing free and the cradle is... Forgot the reasons why - We all lie so pale On the playground of cold Mother Nature is at saturation point and the cradle is falling down... "
45,gojira,explosia,"Jealousy will crush you to the bones Unless you open up and let it go I've only seen too much of it I'm bursting open while you set the tone You ignored this fury too long, I explode Bring back to life this anger, let it grow Put aside mind traps and false beliefs These heavy weights created pull you down The mask you wear is falling Try on and watch it fall Hands down you feel the moment Releasing out a lifetime All prayers to these gods While the tide is growing high Will you make us stronger When you strike us down? "
46,gojira,indians,"Ride a horse that's cleaving through the air and space of dreams travelling through time All alone I pray where am I? Who am I? And that old man trust in me His words are running now because we have lost all guides you're extended now to a world of light you're not the one you think you are since you were born you're only love On a mount I'm standing now and it's coming over me that I'm not here, I am on another plane humping around, hit myself I returned inside of me tears sliding down my face (I die again) And the horse is leaving me running out of space running out of reach you're not the one you think you are since you were born an Indian tribe "
47,gojira,fire is everything,"As I fight, trying to escape Covering my soul Watching the flames I must understand this wizard Fire is everything It burns, I provoke, It's beyond I feel, I create light Hypnotizing power I can't resist Reach out my hands, I feel the light Increase flames, the heat is oppressive Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in... Enter now so deep the flames, I respect the silence Overcome with cold I pray I see all the trees, the sky the grass, the oceans I embrace the world below And I know now all the reasons and all the countries Fire begins and fire ends Oh it burns, fire is all... "
48,gojira,a sight to behold,"Reflecting ourselves in the blood of all the beings we slay Misunderstand each other, out of control we remain There is a mystery, we're facing a sight to behold This is what we make of the world, we throw everything away The way we all behave is not understandable It is so sad to see the wealth of our planet fade away We all behave like children, taking off the head of our teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back We drain the oceans and suck all the blood out of the soil We spend the time we have left fighting and killing each other Lust for comfort, entertainment becomes an obsession And there is so much time to kill The way I see things is so simple The fact I'm walking standing on this land Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying The living creatures on our side The way I see myself so confused so sophisticated I have to stay away from me But I still don't get the point What's worth destroying all the worlds Try not to get it anymore You burn yourself, set fire for good We die eyes closed, dig our own grave now Tossed in the blaze naked on the flame Lost with no pride, drowned in the filth The giant snake is coming down to eat our heads and the flood will kill us, Mantus is rising from under The way I see things is so simple The fact I'm living dying on this land Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying The living creatures on our side The way I see myself so confused so sophisticated Don't have to stay away from me But I still don't get the point What's worth destroying all the worlds Try not to get it anymore Try not to get it anymore Try not to get it anymore Try not to get it anymore "

50,gojira,deliverance,"Your words are so cold to me Indisposed, don't hear your orders Destroy the greatness of soul Normalize what's in your hands Take a look from the future Get up from your dream and see Deliverance soon is coming For those who know I take a sword in my hand now I fight & kill Thanatos Feel the ground under your feet The roots so deep Every step I chose to make was just a kind of torture I changed my ways Now positive the fear became Can't control my arms Emergy too strong, I feel Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside For those who know, I want to be as clear, as real, as I protect Nothingness is all around I hate the taste of your words Every step I chose to make was just a kind of torture I changed my ways Now positive the fear became I hate the taste of my lost illusions I choose to live for the only reasons I felt on the ground I want to try "

52,gojira,wolf down the earth,"First of all you will eat all the bodies No matter they pray for freedom they'll kill you Forward you crush those going backward The wolves are now your lords Voracious flames upon the earth Second step you eat all the creation Swallow the trees the lakes and all the valleys Crush the moon, and drink the rivers flowing Deep rolling ocean blow Burning all that lives They teach you how to conquer and rule the world The towers that you built so strong, no man can touch They tell you how to find and raise the fears and let them grow inside of your heart they need no walls Is there a chance you face the void inside? Winds of doom will blow your pride away Behold the bright lights coming down on time Before these altars black, made from your sacrifice You take for granted what's been there for ages Inside the womb the new blood gets ready to fight The buildings of our fathers crumbling in dark vibrations Wolf down the one that made us all No hope, you wolf down the earth "
53,gojira,space time,"Space Time I fix my attention on this ball spinning round inside of me, deep inside Revolving conscious planet on an axis around this star By the light And the black holes in the vault of heaven make me wonder, wonder why How matter can disappear Are there doors in this wall to reach the light from time and space Now I see those mounts of fear feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity I can touch this wind of night that erases our light and makes us paranoiac But my legs are now so tired climbing all alone, all space, and all the time So I fix my attention now on this perfect planet revolving around this star And the sun, it seems so close I can touch the heat of presence and I know... I can see this monster light that embraces those notions: space and time The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why Light blackened? Door opened? Swim back time, door giving entrance to Supernova as only light Meet the earth and all the stars The entrance, the essence, supply us "
54,gojira,from mars,I just looked myself Straight in the eyes and saw That I had to move To higher places So I took my courage In both hands and I pushed off the ground With all my might Took off from the red place In the sky I fly I have lost my reason And I've made my sense From up there I will see Where I'm from And where the force of love Will tell me now to go But why do you say That you are lost If you don't even try To find yourself My words are a stair I put my feet on And I climb through A starless night to my place

I think therefore I am I feel like I know this land But it must be so far away... This world is life This ""clouds-and-wonders"" Is all I need And it will never go You say it's lost I don't believe it This is my vision We can never know This is the earth But ages after I know the world Will overcome its' pain The simple fact I dream about it Already makes it Happen in the rain It's right in front But you don't face it I'm dedicated All my life in me And made of light Our sun is growing Like in the heart of some of us I pray And other lands You will discover This form of life Is not the only one I was a child And I just knew it And now I know The vision came alive "

The rage in their souls wait to attack Killing the child. The son of God shall burn. Crucifiers At one with the dark Defying the words of the world. At one with their rage Their numbers increase. Awaiting the lights judgement day, Exposing those who are opposed to the blade. The blood of the lamb spilled anointing the face. Screaming their words demanding moral decay Taken by force in darkness they find their way. Wage the war on life Suffocation of those who inhabit the light And crucify the worshippers. So they may die the same as their God Their screams in vain ring in my ears. Caressing my soul with their fears; Devourment consuming the blood. Their bodies are left for their God. Incinerate the enemy's flesh, Melted away by the burning force of the rage Which we possess. Growing inside the hatred, disgust and detest To be released on those who oppose Resist or try to defeat. The quest were on The strength of our numbers. Completely devouring all Defying the light. Burning inside No escaping the dark Destiny calls. Exposing those who are opposed to the blade, The blood of the lamb spilled anointing the face. Screaming their words demanding moral decay, Taken by force in darkness they find their way.

76,monstrosity,the angels venom,"Stagnant in this existence, I quest to free my mind. No longer captive This freedom my desire. My quest never ending With flames I light my path. Yet death impending, Shadows me on my way. So the quest consumes me As poison in my blood. Pulling my body downward Soon sleeping death shall come. And how the light it tempts me, I hear the trumpets call. Tasting the lips of angels, My soul is ripped apart. Lost, awake, yet dreaming. Asleep, yet conscious still, My soul extracted. I stumble through the dark. I have no vision, Yet I see everything. The essence coursing Ascension killing me. Burn, the angels venom raging through my veins. Violent hallucination venom draining me. The trumpets ringing the light begins to fade Into a new existence I am thrown again. Burning in distress and my body reeling, Traumatic visions form My mind erases Memories I'll never know. Listen to the screams of the souls in mourning Dissolving entity. Shown the ways of horror Writhing ecstasy. Burn the angels venom raging through my veins. Violent hallucination, venom draining me. The trumpets ringing the light begins to fade, Into a new existence I am thrown again. Hear the voices of the dying crying out to me. I hear the message clearly, voice of infinity Their words caress me and tell me of my end. Into the door of passage will I know flesh again? So the quest consumes me as poison in my blood, Pulling my body downward, sleeping death will come. Now the light it tempts me, I hear the trumpets call; Tasting the lips of angels my soul is ripped apart. By PhMetal "
77,monstrosity,perpetual war,"Stare in the face of this humanity; Frantic beings searching for their immortality. Hear the rage of the ending call And fight for life in the war on death. Perpetual War Fight Replenish mortal form Replaced with an artificial one. An illusion of continuance Life sustained only to be consumed. Strive to see the end of a mortal plague, Only to be defeated again. Discover cures, alter destiny Incubation of doom. Much more aggressively Burns in the fear of their passing on. Descent to darken oblivion To withstand the course of time, Is to deny the very fact that we die. Regression into the hands of disease we resist Fools imploring their Gods for regrets. Pray to idols for their sanity Yet ultimately reach submission. Into the hands of death we detest So surgery is performed. Open flesh for alteration To preserve our being. Pawns in perpetual war we engage. Stare in the face of this humanity Frantic beings searching for their immortality. Hear the rage of the ending call And fight for life in the perpetual war. The passion for the flesh And the burning desire we have to exist. Observe the weakness of our entity And in the quest for matter Become a casualty. Fight Replenish mortal form Replaced with an artificial one. An illusion of continuance Life sustained only to be consumed. "

A malicious maternal seed spewed forth in precarious birth from the womb into the trash. Precious, twisting life, crawling on the filth of the dumpster floor. Only known to the mother in guilt, as she stumbles from the alley covered in flies. With a ten mile stare dead to the world she never gave one fuck for the child inside... none. Sucks the crack pipe in shame just to forget. Yet with another hit, she's on the streets again in another life she once had hope. But that went down the drain. Along with her pride. Nurses habitually resigned. Tossing the carcass, in the waste bin death legally designed? Or fixing the future with quick extraction? Conceived and thrown away from womb into the waste. Human trash, putrid, the bodies overrun. Aborted removal, with cold precision. Tools specifically designed forcing fetal termination. Blind the morally enraged. Bomb the clinic into oblivion. Kill the killer they will say. Justice through murder goes both ways. Conceived and thrown away from womb into the waste. One more girl, mortified. Never knew what was growing within. Obese, diseased, down on her knees she gave birth on the toilet seat. Insert anesthetize. Late term feticide. Orphan spawned from rape. Short lived, half a face. Crackhead whore for host. Hatching living ghosts. Pregnant, drunk and high. It was no surprise, when she left it there to die. One more girl who could never conceive. Psychopath, maternity-mad. Took a steel bat to her mother's head, hacked her up and took the baby out. One more girl, six months in, takes a hanger and a bottle of pills. The pro-life priest has nothing to say as the embryo's scraped away. Straight into the trash with the unborn offspring, generations dead in time, progeny unwanted. Dead flesh pile a mass of cells, 10 more bags and the landfill swells. Ripened mass fetal decay, no one cares were they human anyway? "

There was a time, when the weak would suffer. The ones in power would crush all who dissent. Just look around, because nothing's changed. No longer kings, they wear a suit and tie. Those who survive, have no conviction Just follow trends, until they're born again. So who will live, and who will die? It's up to us to carry on the fight.

A shit-city built on the backs of the poor where the real world is buried beneath. While tourists and business, partners in greed devour the fruit of the land. Starving and dying, assassins surround to kill them. Praying for something or someone to set them free. Life in Babylon, post-A.D., defined in terms of what can you do for me. The world outside is full of rot, so walls divide the burn of acid air, and black-cloud skies. Death squads are crawling the city, in search of the worthless to fill up mass graves. Corrupted and careless, degrading all life these cops are the killers, well-trained. Millions of people stand dead at their feet, begging for mercy denied. Breathing pollution and slaving to eat, they're humans, but empty inside. Rise, out of the slums, they seek to fight, fight to defend. Nothing is left but a future of death. Awaiting the poor, who starve just to breathe. Breathe in the air, now they shall be reborn. How can you think that our world is so good? The red, white and blue blinds your eyes. When everything's fine in your white neighborhood, who cares for the dying outside? Forced to rebellion, uprising they're tearing through the walls of confinement, uprooted The promise of a third world resistance, the power is overtaken. Nightfall in Sodom, it's burning. It's time to bring it down. Now the time has come at last, to give back what they demand. Just a chance for life, and peace far away from famine and disease. Power has changed across the world now, It's just the money that rules in Sodom today. And the bastards that run the corporate plan, will be choking on their blood when the masses make them pay. "

In this latest chapter, whilst naively excavating in the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka, we have unwittingly awakened our protagonist from his long, restful interment. After wreaking his underworld vengeance upon us for disturbing him from his oblivion, he is tormented by memories of the unholy transgressions that had caused him his anguished eternal entombment... in all seriousness, though, I sometimes get the uneasy feeling that perhaps it would be best to leave Lovecraft's characters sleeping, undisturbed in an eternal dormant state - dead, as it were, but dreaming.

He is said to have lived from 2375 to 2345 B.C., but some Egyptologists date him as far back as 5330 B.C. The internal structure of his pyramid is known for incorporating several innovative features, but is most recognized for the inclusion of vertical lines of hieroglyphs on the walls of the vestibule and burial chamber. When Maspero opened the Unas pyramid in 1881, he found texts covering these stone walls to be extremely difficult to decipher, because of their archais characters, forms, and spellings. These were magickal/religious texts, designed to ensure the safe passage of the Pharaoh into the next world. They are known today as the ""Pyramid Texts."" According to these texts, Unas became great by eating the flesh of his mortal enemies and then slaying and devouring the gods themselves. Those gods that were old and worn out (Egyptian gods aged and died) were used as fuel for Unas's fire. After devouring the gods and absorbing their spirits and powers, Unas journeys through the day and night sky to become the star Sabu, or Orion. While this is certainly not the first reference to cannibalism in Old Kingdom texts, what is notable is the method by which the Pharaoh Unas achieves deification and immortality; by turning on the gods, slaying and then devouring them, and thus ascending to the heavens to become the star Orion. The concept was remarkable to Maspero, who found the idea to be of ""absolute savagery."" Maspero seemed to be reeling from a confrontation with a symbolic revival of pre-dynastic cannibalistic rites - which are suggested, according to Maspero, by the gnamed and disconnected bones found in certain early graves. Professor Petrie suggests that at the original Sed festival, the tribal king appears to have been sacrificed and devoured, so that his people might derive from his flesh and blood the power and virtues which made him great. This practise was based on a belief in contagious magick. Bulls and boars were eaten to give men strength and courage, deer to give fleetness of foot, and serpents to give cunning. The blood of slain and wounded warriors was drunk so that their skill and bravery might be imparted t the drinkers. Similarly, Unas feasts after death on the spirits of the gods, and on the bodies of men and gods. He swallows their spirits, souls, and names, which are contained in their hearts, livers, and entrails, thus, Unas becomes allpowerful. In attempting to bring this epic-length text to song from, it was necessary to make some minor concessions, firstly, that every version I have at home of the text is translated somewhat differently, and thus there is not any singularly definitive versions; and secondly, that it would just not be possible to include every last line from the original text. That would probably necessitate a song inconceivable in length. As it is, in concise song lyric form, ""Unas Slayer of the Gods"" weighs in at about 12 minutes plus - and that is using what would be considered only the bare minimum essential lines for the development and presentation of the main aspects of the text. For those interested in reading the entire work, there are several versions readily available online or by ordering from a local bookstore. I typed in ""Unas Slayer of the Gods"" in a couple of search engines and was astounded at the number of results that came back.] "

The story takes place in the latter half of the 14th Dynasty, and is about a struggle to restore the majesty of the Pharaoh of Pharaohs. Tanus, leader of the mighties army of Egypt, the Blue Crocodile Regiment, hunted down and destroyed the Shrikes, a horrid nomadic tribe of thieves, rapists, and murderers that played the Egyptians. The title of the song, ""Wind of Horus,"" refers to the name of the boat of the Blue Crocodile Regiment. It is an enchantment of the god Horus to cause the wind to blow the Egyptians' sails in time of need. The repeated chant in the song is to invoke the god Ashu, who robs the enemies of the Egyptians of their virtues, weakening and destroying them. The word Lanata is mentioned in the song. Lanata was a bow made for Tanus by Taita the slave and was made of wood, ebony, rhinocerus horn, and ivory tusks. The bowstring was made out of the guts of a lion that Tanus had killed with his bronze-bladed war spear. Tanus was probably the only one in his army strong enough to use the Lanata bow. It had so much tension that he had to use a different technique just to pull the bowsting back. Tanus practised until he could shoot three arrows at a time piercing the heaviest of armor.] "

The scenes depicted in this chapter describe some of the tortures which are inflicted upon the original enemies of Osiris. It is impossible for Osiris to slay all of his enemies at once, even though they are in his power. While various batches of them are awaiting their turn at the Block of Slaughter, they are kept tightly fettered and bound. One of the forms of the torture depicted described the ""Kheftin Asar Butchiu,"" i.e., the enemies of Osiris who are to be burned. Their arms are tied behind their backs in positions which cause intense pain, and they are doomed to stand and receive in their faces the fire which the serpent Khetti is about to spit at them, and then be hacked to pieaces and burnt. Horus commands the serpent Khetti, saying ""Open thy mouth! Distend thy jaws and belch forth thy flames against my father's enemies! Consume their souls by the fire which issueth from thy mouth and by the flames which art in thy body.""] "

Entitled, ""The Chapter for Bringing Heka to those who Burn,"" the author claimed it was part of a larger collection of works known as ""The Book of Resurrection Apophis."" In Egyptian methology, Apophis is also known as Apep, the terrible monster serpent who, in dynastic times, was a personification of the darkness of the darkest hour of night. Apeop is the dreaded embodiment of utter evil in the form of a giant snake that arises anew each night to struggle against the Sun god, Ra. Against Apep, Ra must not only fight, but must succesfully conquer morning sun, lest darkness and chaos engulf the entire earth during the day as well. Apep was both crafty and evil doing, and, like Ra, possessed many names, to destroy him it was necessary to curse him by each and every name by which he as known. In Egyptian papyri, Apep is also represented in the form of an enormous serpent, into each undulation of which a knife is stuck. In the Book of Gates, we see him fastened by the neck with a chain (along which is fastened the Goddess, Serqet), the end of which is in the hands of a god, and also chained to the ground with five chains. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), Apophis is also the name the Hyskos king Aussere adopted during his reign over the conquered and subjugated Egypt of 1570 B.C. The Hyskos had invaded Egypt and established their new political and religious capical city, Avaris, in the delta region of Egypt. Avaris is also the site of the original Temple of Set. Set (or Sutekh, to the Hyskos) wa the chief god of the Hyskos at that time, but in Egyptian mythology since pre-dynastic times, Set was the murderous brother of Osiris, and the original ultimate embodiment of the forces of darkness, chaos and evil, at whose command was te monster serpent, Apep. During the early period of the Hyskos occupation, the Hyskos faced little significant opposition. But during the reign of Apophis I, the Theban princes of Egypt rose up to drive the Hyskos back out of Egypt, a feat that is recounted on two large stelae set up by Kamose in the Temple of Amun at Karnak. The text which I received was in three languages - Egyptian, Greek and modern English, along with rubric instructions for the proper recitation of the chants, which are to be memorized and repeated as a sort of mantra, and as such should be spoken in Egyptian rather than English. The translations were given only to throw light upon the meanings of the spell. Upon closer examination of the text, it seems to bear superficial resemblance to Chapter 24 of the Papyrus of Ani, ""The Chapter for Bringing Magick to Ani,"" (which is also known in some Books of the Dead as ""The Chapter for Gaining Power,"" and in modern ritualmagick as ""The Gathering of Heka."") But the similarities go immediately astray, for ""The Chapter for Bringing Heka to those who Burn"" seems as though it is, in this incarnation, a blasphemous underworld perversion of the chapters contained in the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead. Perhaps it was intended for use by ancient cultists who would be intent upon using the darker forces of Chaos and the spiritual energy of those souls burning in the fiery pits of torment in the underworld for their own cultist ambitions of the upsetting the orderer structure of the ancient Egyptian world. More likely, their goal was probably to alter the political balance of rival religious factions in the turmoil of those tumultuous intermediate times. By the end of the 14th Dynasty, Egypt's once considerable might as a nation had eroded due to internal political struggles, so that it was unable to defent itself against invaders. The Hyskos overwhelmed the Dynasty, remaining in power until being expelled during the 17th Dynasty ina great war, which lasted, according to Manetbo, about a quarter of a century.] "

Lovecraft, and to a lesser degree, Robert E. Howard. It tills the story of a rebellions Serpent cult who are plotting to overthrow Pharonic rule. They are attempting to raise the spirits of the ancient dead, to barness thei arcane knowledge and build an army of undead legions. The story takes place within the subterranean main ch.mber of the crypts of mummified reptiles (true enough, archaeologists have indeed unearthed entire necropolises containing thousand of mummified crocodiles, serpents, ancient Nile monitor lizards, and various other animals that were worshiped as personifications of the gods they represented). Within these dark and bloodstained halls are not only the remains of three millenia of generations of priests and worshippers, but also the mummified corpses of all manner of glorified reptilian deities. The leader of these rebels is standing in the midst of this vast array of Saurian entombment, inciting insurrection and preparing for some sort of violent revolution. Their ill-fated sedition comes to naught, however, when their temple is destroyed and they are all slain in a catastrophic violent climax. Whether this is perhaps divine intervention and retribution by the Sun god, Ra, or perhaps military action by the armies of the Pharaoh (who is a worshipper of Ra) putting down a violent rebellion, or merely the indiscriminate vengeance of the undead that the conspirators were seeking to enslave, is unclear. The passage that tells of the descruction and demise of the rebel fiends is reminiscent of the magickal/religious ceremony in The Book of Overthrowing Apep, in which the terrible monster serpent Apep is forever crushed by the Sun god, Ra, nver to rise up again. In the aftermath, all that is left of the Temple, the Serpent Cult and their subterranean catacombs of the tombs is a mass of rubble and forgotten ruins which are eventually covered over by the sands of time, explainined in a passage that borrows quite literally from The Nameless City by H.P. Lovecraft.] "

Such objects survive to this day usually only when they are buried as a part of a rite, and usually in the vicinity of a tomb or necropolis. Archeologist have found the remains of such rites at the royal cemetaries of Giza, Saqqarra, Lisht, and at several forts in Nubia. Stone, wax, or mud figures, or broken clay tablets or clay pots, are inscribed with lists of the enemies of Egypt. The body of the figure is usually flattened to make room for the text, or sometimes a papyrus is inserted inside the body cavity. On the back, the arms, or the arms and legs, are bound together. The inscriptions found on them are called ""execration texts."" These texts threaten death to specific people. Often, they include the name, parentage, and title of war. The execration texts were mainly aimed at enemy rulers, hostile nations, and tribes in Nubia, Libya, and Syria-Palestine. Magickal incantations and rites were used to cause death and suffering, and to prevent the angry spirits of the executed from taking vengeance on those who had condemned them. Usually included in these texts are long-standing enemies of those involved in the cursing rites. There is also often a catchball phrase against any man, woman, or eunuch who might be plotting rebellion. Amongst the common people, the execration rituals were carried out after the killing of a personal enemy or the execution of criminals. By killing the enemy's name, which was an integral part of the personality, this rite would extend the punishment into the afterlife. The spirits of defeated enemies or executed traitors were regarded as a continued supernatural threat, which needed to be met with magic. The wording of the texts is similar to that of contemporary spells on papyrus, which promise to protect against the malice of demons and ghosts. Those named in the execration texts are referred to as ""mut"" - the dangerous dead. It is also the word used to describe the troublesome dead in protective spells for private persons. The stone figures and red clay pots on which the execration texts were written were ritually broken as part of the cursing ceremony in order to smash the enemy's power. A pit near the Egyptian fort of Mirgissa in Nubia contained hundreds of such pot shards, as well as over 350 figures. Deposite of figures have been found outside fortresses, tombs, and funerary temples. The clay figures were burned and then buried with iron spikes driven through them, or nailed to the outer walls, as the bodies of executed traitors and foreign enemies sometimes were. The more eloborate enemy figures were sometimes trussed up like animals about to be sacrificed. Some are shown with their throats cut, the method used to kill sacrificial animals. The dismembered body of a Nubian and a flint sacrificial knife were found nar the Mirgissa pit. Some Egyptologists believe that human sacrifices routinely accompanied execration rituals, while others have argued that the figures were normally a substitute for such sacrifices.] "

Those who had lived a moral life, observed the proper burial rites and procedures, and possessed all the correct magickal spells to navigate the treacherous and horrific Egyptian underworld, who could recite the 42 negative confessions, and whose hearts were found to be pure at the ""Weighing of the Heart,"" were then allowed to be ""Osirified"" - to become a person like as unto Osiris - and enjoy a pleasant afterlife as ne of the blessed dead.] [Proper burial, though, was an expensive undertaking. It was usually afforded only by pharaohs, priests, and the wealthy class. What of those who could not afford the extravagant tombs, mummification, magickal amulets, and costly papurys texts on which were written the necessary spells for successfully navigating the underworld? Even linen, which was used to wrap the mummies, was so expensive in ancient Egypt that people had to save what little scraps of it they could for years to have enough to have themselves wrapped. Also of mention would be the cost of professional mourners, embalmers, and priests for the ""Opening of the Mouth"" ceremony. This was all extremely expensive. Even a wealthy person in ancient Egypt would spend a lifetime saving and preparing for his or her burial and afterlife. I suppose it is no small coincidence that the religious priests were directly involved in the embalming industry.] [But what of the middle and lover classes of people - the common working man? What then of the slaves and servant classes? if all these costly preparations and arcane knowledege were essential to achieving a state of blessedness in the afterlife, would a person of limited financial means be condemned beforehand to burn in torment in the afterlife, so only the wealthy became the Blessed Dead? While most of the populate certainly accepted this fatalistic concept - and by all that we know of ancient Egypt, embraced life and the hope of an eternal afterlife - most ancient Egyptians probably were resigned to do whatever funereal preparations were within their means It stands to reason, however, that certainly some small number of lower income / slave / working class people (predestined, of course, to certain financial / spiritual doom, as upward caste mobility was very limited in ancient times) would be less than inclined to accept at face value the idea that, no matter what, by the end of their lives they would not be able to afford to be buried as one of the blessed dead. Would they be resigned to their eternal fate, or live their lives with subversive viewpoints - perhaps rebelling against the established religious order, or perhaps choosing to worship amongst the pletbora of ""other gods"" of the Egyptian pantheon? (Budge refers to them as, ""Wretched little gods."")] [Certainly the existence of the ancient cult worship of the god, Set, is not without some sort of seditious causality. Perhaps these, then, are the countless legions of souls damned to fiery pits of torment in the underworld: the ""Hated of Ra"" or ""Enemies of Osiris."" This probably would also liken these wretched and lost souls to be followers of Set and his Seban fiends, who were the original enemies of Osiris and precursor role models on which later religious based their ideas of ""Hell"" and ""Satan"" and his ""infernal legions."" I am reminded of John Milton, who, in Paradise Lost, wrote of Lucifer, after he had been cast down and came to realization of his unrepentant autonomy, ""It is better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven."" And thus, that brings us full circle to the chorus refrain of ""The Blessed Dead."" complete with infernal choirs of the underworld defiantly proclaiming, ""We Shall Never Be The Blessed Dead.""] "

454,suffocation,thrones of blood,The thought of killing entered my mind some time ago. What possesses an individual to kill. I have often pondered the thought. Time and time again. Now it's clear to me. They want me to be part of this world they have created. I say fuck you. Don't tell me how to live. Maybe if I eliminate the people. Who fit this so - called mold. My pain will finally be released. And my mind free of thought. The ax struck hard and fast. Splitting the skull in two. She fell instantly. The blood spewed. From where her head used to be. I then struck another blow. Only the lives of others. Can quench my harsh reality. I received much excitement. From these two blows. I must continue to strike her corpse. Once again I brought the tool of my trade. I proceeded to hack several more times. A pile of flesh now lies before me. Unrelenting need to fulfill my lust for death. I must purge the world of it's filth. Disorder scars my mind. With killing fascination. My tasks are far from done. Everything must die

457,suffocation,pierced from within,"Penetrate the minds of those misfortuned at birth. Murder is etched in the deepest chasms of the soul. Salvation stripped from the origin of existence. Obstinacy abandons, as you yield your world to me. Decree of my darkest dreams. Memories of my future. Welcome to my church. Sodomize my cross for it now marks your existence. Dismissal of lucivity, consume my body and blood. Supplicate for death, obscurity condemns the structure. Spectral abominations, the gathering of souls. Befall the rise of inhumanity.

458,suffocation,torn into enthrallment,"Brain patterns altered since birth. To serve the higher cause. Pawns of twisted vision. Manipulate to do thy bidding. It is easy for them. To control us this way. To think is obsolete. Therefore no way to question their rule. A mindless, lifeless zombie. To walk the rest of it's days. There's only one law to serve them. All else results in termination. Breeding is done by means of test tubes. It seems strange to me to end up this way. Torn from my state of being. Stripped of all my worth. I can no longer feel what is being done to be. I have awakened. Yet cannot move. Paralysis has stricken me. I pray for death. I cannot speak. Enslavement now possesses me. Bleed, bleed. You scream at me. Draining. Worthless is my soul you say. You feed the lie. The collapse my will. Feed, feed. On what's left of me. Eating away at a life I once lived. You left me in your wake. Or so you think. Vigilant in your plans to deny. You will not overtake. To win the stakes. I will not cower to your lies. Your foolish greedy mind. Is filled with selfish pride. It will bring you to your knees. Flailing in the cess. This convoluted mess. The origin of your disease "

Now that I control the rest of your existence. How does it feel to be in pain and misery. For many years you made me feel that way. I praised you for so long. I'm now your God. I cannot control my urges. Now I must take my revenge. I slice at you. You begin to die. The pleasure was all yours. To have the strength to leave and not look back. To give up completely. No more will to survive. Now that all is done. My completed masterpiece. This sinful life of mine. Will not go to waste. The pleasure's all mine. To have taken your mortal life. I am what you created. To inflict my own pain and misery. You manipulated my mind. Filled it with your lies. Feasted on my soul. Destroyed my will. Now there's nothing. No reason for reason. Now I must take life. To repent my sins

466,suffocation,mass obliteration,"Warfare, a promise to eliminate mankind. The planet as we know it, taken by demented minds. Warheads produced to exterminate the earth. The sacrifice will lead us to our death, no rebirth. No one has the power to declare this world to die. Voting and electing the right to crucify. Times of turmoil have decided what to do.

What is it's form? Questions still asked yet unanswered. No need for answers, with it's arrival brings sorrow, a sorrow soon dealt upon all. Perhaps it's a pestilence in a form of virus spreading in it's own epidemic. Perhaps it is famine killing off millions. Does this happen 'cause we lack enough food. One man's greed affects others less privileged, a cruel form of population control. Why does this happen? It is predestined fate not open for reason or change.

My receiving eyes exchanged with fuses; blindness induced to prevent destruction. Ceramic blades implanted past my ribs to save me from the dues of inhalation. I tear my worldly useless skin. Staples to pin it over my ears. Non-receptive of ungodly sounds - I disable the audio-generators of fear. Hexagonal bolts to fill my mouth, sharpened to deplete the creator of all violence; Without speech there will be no deceit Baptized in vitriolic acid, a final touch, a smoothing of features. Completion of the greatest art; to cast the godly creatures. Humans, once astray; made divine, stripped of congenital flaws. We're incandescent revelations in a world of darkened forms. Disciples! Come join with me to save a failed humanity. Follow the god of cyanide into the new eternity. Behold! A sacrificial race a cleansing worshipping of pain. The new millenium christ here to redeem all from lies. "

We destroy all we create We'd rather send death and debt to our future Than love and technology. We live in a society with a fever for physical death or it don't exist.

Collectively, we longed for an amendment (to life). Easier... Simple... Apathetic. Uncultivated areas of our brain the silent nursery.
