0,gojira,flying whales,"At the very first sound There was just light And then, a storm Of time and space Just came and struck Created our time In water life We understand It just only began  Forced to look to the sky And wonder why We cannot face the fact that We're all scared now Of mysteries of life There is a mask that soon will fall Before the strong embrace Of love and might Of light in the dark I go for a quest I have to give myself the answer Enter now this place in the wild I can see the glade My feeling now is growing bigger  From the sky From the sky  I do feel like no one can save me I am so alone and yet I cried I called for help, forsaken But now I know The only way is to Understand the living Obey the rule of light And face the fear Inside out!  Lost, I found there a stone Erected in line With one the brightest stars Of all the night sky vault And I took my time Took off the moss Washed away the dust And gave a new lease of life Its' mystical force I grab it now And praise this lord Of earth and stone Make passage for souls awaken So it returns To where it's always been With the gods Now coming, I feel the love It comes from on high  I know the words But now I feel it inside It grows, it's there And all it comes From the sky From the sky"

11,gojira,pain is a master,"Crawling and moaning in the sharp blade of grass All my life starting over, blood spilled inside out I went through this cycle of pain deep in myself Destroyed by awful hands, a demon of illusion The pain now awaken, I'm cracking wide open Can barely recognize my body, a battlefield Unquestioned pride once so fragile I cannot even recall names or faces Those standing on my side Those standing on my side, always My side I am nothing, the pain awake is forging me Face down, inert Forcing me, dreams haunting me I am immense, I am awake, renewed Lost in the darkest time I know I felt their presence Even if I was blind, face down I was blind Pain, please forgive my ignorance My master "
12,gojira,born in winter,"before all things reborn again you learn the painful breath of time cold morning stretches out your arms to the mighty warmth of one golden sun seems all have gone insane for gold all was created out of the night we're all born from the burst of a star the day you'll come to life you'll realize expanding force of life where you belong and in the winter cold, with opened eyes you'll find the strength to fight and stand upright one day you'll walk the world and keep in mind the heart you've been given in winter time and through the bitter cold, with opened eyes you'll find the strength to fight and stand upright "
13,gojira,the cell,"All this evil, sanctified You're not alone You're not the only one Overcrowded in your brain You'll find a way out, or you will fall! Get me out of here I've been lost in the dark Get me out of here I'm locked inside me No control over anything I'm dying to learn I'm dying to forget Overcrowded in my mind I have to let it go, now Get me out of here I've been lost in the dark Get me out of here No Overcrowded in our minds We'll find a way out, right now Now! Now! Now! Lyrics from oficial booklet (from CD) "
14,gojira,global warming,"Four hundred thousand years ago They came from outer space And gave us life here And we are just taking everything for granted I don't think we should do this now And when I see the smoke around I feel like I'm not from Humankind down there I feel like glaciers are my eyes And mountains are my head My heart is ocean And I feel all alone Cause everybody is wrong I fear the living What is this thing that we call hate And that's inside of me Get out of here!  A world is down And none can rebuild it Disabled lands are evolving My eyes are shut, a vision is dying My head explodes And I fall in disgrace  I hold my inner child within And tell him not to cry ""Don't fear the living"" One day you will stand as a king And no fear can erase This light below us Each one of us is now engaged This secret we all have This truth is growing And as a warrior I have to fight I can already feel The love I'll discover  I had this dream, our planet surviving The guiding stars always glowing And all the wealths The fates of the countries They're all rebuilding at the same time I never fell and always believed it We could evolve and get older Open thy eyes and let all this flow in Now see a new hope is growing inside  We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing We will see our children growing"

16,gojira,planned obsolescence,"Created weakness for the number on the board Absurd amount of things, obsolete creation The lust for always more, indulgence is hunger A greed of power, the demon needs to feed From cradle you've been taught how to rule and conquer The devil smiling, not this isn't real Black vultures in the mist approaching, now closer The end is coming, we'll take it from there A message goes to all the souls To all those staying, face turned to the ground You hold the key to infinite power That has always been here and forever Every time you step out, raise your voice Resurrected from the ground Designed for failure Behold of the waste is burnt to the ground Face down and broken We dedicate our essence to this game No better, time, let's dream on, wish for better You're on an elevated sense of greater These engines, power crushing down One day we'll wake up from this absolute nonsense A star long worshiped will burn in the red Disused and empty shell, icon of an old world Conscience awakened, we'll take it from there "
17,gojira,only pain,"Since day one you try your best To get what you need the most The solution is you, becoming a god Only pain, all in vain The day you get to the point All illusions are lost The problem is you, becoming so cold Just wanted to be good Just wanted to be gold Just wanted to be god Just wanted to be ... Only pain, all in vain Take all, fear none Wake up, go strong I'm the lamb It's just another offering I reclaim the might and power Cast away long before dawn In a cage left to rot Creature fierce, tamed, is dying Lost the feel for all I've loved It's too strong I'm going down "
18,gojira,toxic garbage island,"Mysterious form, soul in the dark under this heavy sealing concrete waves Followed by servants, funeral cortege this pale ghost is gathering his strength Ghost, pale, the procession is crawling Plastic form dead things it is now so clear How could I fail to understand Cities are burning the trees are dying My heart awake but still pain is killing me Pain is killing me Take this pestilent destruction out of my way The great pacific garbage patch is exhausting And the world is sliding away in a vortex of floating refuse With the sacred one you have lost Plastic bag in the sea Plastic bag in the sea Plastic bag in the sea Plastic bag in the sea "
19,gojira,the gift of guilt,"We leave the shores to see the mountains rising A distant impression growing This judgment creates the pain we hold Destructive intentions that serve no purpose But the end of us all These vultures from the past, coming In all the hells and worlds, the time has come Delivered from their eyes Embrace, suffer, destroy - the gift of guilt The shame and sorrow, self-condemnation Fell all the gaps and the spaces, unyielding Bestowed upon us, devastating power We're building connective tissue to a maze of lies We're left as starving orphans The vital core is gone Our sins are all over and over again we swallow We're sick and tired when this wind blows The reflex is insane We must forgive and stop blaming ourselves for this love These vultures from the past, coming In all the hells and worlds, the time has come Delivered from their eyes I'm leaving this behind - the gift of guilt "
20,gojira,the heaviest matter of the universe,"Lay down fall away Lie awake Just cannot move My arms and legs I'm paralyzed Don't recall how to free Myself from this In the heart of the dark My face contorted Don't know how to reach the light But I feel so bad Like a freak in a cage Open the door Enter your heart You go so far Golden unworldly silence Space flight at speed of light I cross the clouds and colors The black hole is calling me I slide on the horizon On the frontier not to cross Black dwarf Time's gone distorted In the heart of the dark A whirl of light Enter in The realm of nothingness I feel the cold, my eyes are shut My fear is slowly dying Light years from here Are my thoughts and cages I can hear their moan But now a long deep breath Is calling Overtaking time And now understanding space I feel united I do cross light Feel the living Here in the center Stands the light of love That never can be touched From greater silence Shall return "
21,gojira,the shooting star,"On the first light of the day you march on Departure has arrived, don't look back Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight Until you feel the blast of a shooting star Following the spark like a rocket in the sky Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close Headed north, frozen land, where tigers go to die Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out You are higher In the sky Learn the skill to stay alive, survival The city is so mean, you're being watched Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt Until the light calls you back into the wild When you get to the other side please send a sign It'll fly through the atmosphere in time And if you hold the truth within your hands You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn Everlasting love is ever-growing Hang on to what you have and let it grow Everlasting love is ever-dying It's in the past, you have to let it go "
22,gojira,liberation,(instrumental) 
23,gojira,ocean planet,"I'm in a mental cage I'm locked up Imprisoned I live Deathlike, sickening Strong is your hold On my resignation I don't see the stars My memories are veiled  In fluid dreams I fall I'm restless Walls made of stone Are turned into water now Enlightened demons Are taking me by the hand Approaching me This great eye speaking  Mountainous waves Are breaking on my despair Awaken me but I'm still dreaming And I just plunge Into this sea of light Set open the doors of soul I'm living  Lightning struck me I see the path I was so scared of And fly to the stars Conviction now increasing at last My skin is broken I see the smallest part of me My mind is alive But I'll never bow to this again  Why do they call me there How can I fly All this water I don't feel like I could ever swim to them Whales in the sky I feel they're so close Inside, and yet so far away  Burst into tears, I feel sad My dreams aflame The force is now Lie on a stone Drop this load and try to see The ocean planet is on burn"
24,gojira,satan is a lawyer,"Lawyer talks, he's so correct, he is respect He learned how to make you feel safe and kill you with a smile And the food so fast, the hair so clean The moon so far, fire so weak All those words flying in the air Cannot see the stars Images, colors, like wrong perfection Wash my brain, dirty it's so clean But who are you? The mixture has no smell Soon you will sit on the bench of those who deny I have my soul You sell a dream you create Condemned by what you condemned before Smooth are the words you sing down and high Underground is your joy your laws Satan is a lawyer You choose the appeerance of the futile Trapped, a coner stops your back, you're out Before you grow you will die... "
25,gojira,esoteric surgery,"You have the power to heal yourself All illness can be healed the cell regenerates disambiguated situation There is a secret code in the structure of the mind You have the power to heal yourself Flesh bodies mute and blinded roaming uncertain, lost infected misinformed Releasing a black enormous insect out from the chest archaic form disease Esoteric surgery a dissection of the soul Unsuspected precise power on the wounded astral body projected beam of light All illness can be healed the cell regenerates disambiguated situation There is a secret code in the structure of the mind You have the power to heal yourself Suspended floating in empty spaces Descending swift like a fire running down Obstruction disintegration life force overcoming all circumstances Release the pain "
26,gojira,from the sky,"At the very first sound There was just light And then, a storm Of time and space Just came and struck Created our time In water life We understand It just only began  Forced to look to the sky And wonder why We cannot face the fact that We're all scared now Of mysteries of life There is a mask that soon will fall Before the strong embrace Of love and might Of light in the dark I go for a quest I have to give myself the answer Enter now this place in the wild I can see the glade My feeling now is growing bigger  From the sky From the sky  I do feel like no one can save me I am so alone and yet I cried I called for help, forsaken But now I know The only way is to Understand the living Obey the rule of light And face the fear Inside out!  Lost, I found there a stone Erected in line With one the brightest stars Of all the night sky vault And I took my time Took off the moss Washed away the dust And gave a new lease of life Its' mystical force I grab it now And praise this lord Of earth and stone Make passage for souls awaken So it returns To where it's always been With the gods Now coming, I feel the love It comes from on high  I know the words But now I feel it inside It grows, it's there And all it comes From the sky From the sky"
27,gojira,1990 quatrillions de tonnes,
28,gojira,magma,"Analyse this chemistry Producing poison And creeping in you veins For the love of blood The poison slowly spreads Through the body and the mind Close your eyes and drop your things Be ready to fly You are now, high In the sun, burn You're away, alive On the moon, round After walking all the miles Consumed into your bones And breathing all the dust Of the desert land I know that all long You were doing it for absolution It's written in you eyes You are now, high In the sun, burn You're away, alive On the moon, round Away Just want to fly away, always higher Away Embrace the light on the other side "
29,gojira,the axe,"I've been a victim to the blade against myself Bloodletting all of my soul Sucked in, paralyzed in this vortex Reduced to the silence In the dark Ive lingered too long This sharpened axe, beam of light I reach for and I master Wield against these shadows Its purpose now revealed in silence Keep searching, question if this light ends Now I will strike and dig with precision Introspective eye, erase the concept I lost my fears and the notion of time I healed my sorrow All boundaries are illusion When you reach the center light And reinforce the striking power By chance you're followed Its purpose now revealed in silence Keep searching, question if this light ends All ghosts dwelling in, inside, in the heart I see them all, release their shadow "
30,gojira,liquid fire,"Ejected from the womb, unrestrained, I'm catching the wind Unfolded fire blows with the words, straight from within The second I was born I found a shelter deep in my own I ventured further out on the edge of the glacier This is how we talk to the world Pure liquid fire running through our veins We're in this alone, we bow to no one Carved by the waves, our sacred temple Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone This is no fiction, we've come to an end now Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight Intelligence of the heart as only guidance Infinite power lies all around us and in the heart The flashes find a way, stealing through these broken walls And when this fire grows, it does it so we can remember The meaning of this life, we'll be marching until the end Had no taste for more lies, we are standing alone The bright treasure we found has no price and no name In the light of this star, with the forces aligned This is how we talk to the world Pure liquid fire running through our veins We're in this alone, we bow to no one Carved by the waves, our sacred temple Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone This is no fiction, We've come to an end now Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight Intelligence of the heart as only guidance "
31,gojira,mouth of kala,"There's a river of time Let us worship this god of destruction On nothing we can reply All is gone, belong to the past You should learn by the time Everything changing over and over We're all falling so fast Keep on burning Overwhelming power Keep on burning, change The old me didn't survive Inexorable transfiguration There is something at war The red tainted flash on the wall I'm nowhere to be found Nothing matters, truth out of sight In the air I dissolve I'm fading away Overwhelming power Keep on burning, change "
32,gojira,the wild healer,INSTRUMENTAL 
33,gojira,the way of all flesh,"Anything that has a shape will crumble away, disappear We belong to the circle life of all creation We crawl and deny ourselves, refuse this evidence that we project our greatest fears on death and forget our power I want to live my life in close touch with the sacred Pacify the disturbances of the mind I face my own death Lower and lower is the pressure, I can feel the parts of me collapsing one into the other Higher state of consciousness awaken, I can see the light of this next world Leading my soul reborn I find it hard to believe that this picture on the wall is everything I do understand all the prayers, life is so sharp and hurts so bad What does it mean to be dying, what if you take the guts and brain away Is it this blood and heartbeat that you call life Every effort to ignore it is unavailing we all have to die Is it too late to dull the edges of the pain, I have to try This is an other dimension You can scatter ashes to the winds and even buried in the ground I'm still here Do not be afraid you are dying and the four great elements of your body are collapsing one into the other It feels as if you are being crushed by mountains The light of this world has faded completely But the light of the next world have not yet appeared Your breath is now still, no warmth to your skin Do not be afraid, there's no way that you can stay here You are leaving this world All lights are fading away now Leave behind the loved ones and all you know Do not be afraid and let yourself go "
34,gojira,embrace the world,"I sit on a rock cannot be touched by struggle & confusion I reclaim my space inside my structure look at this point all is about nothing, everything comes near the remotest parts of the world by silence we can dissolve disruptive vibrations I have to try Gaïa's alive for good under my feet the forest over me the largest It's roundness I feel Lifelong misery How do we get to Avalon? There is a bridge beyond indestructible the earth is a temple I cannot see what is wrong and All gods are one I close my eyes I'm all around, I feel so present embracing it's vastness I hold facing the world I become a part of it I'm not alone anymore I embrace the world "
35,gojira,blow me away you niverse,"Reverse, blow me in that black hole down there Return through perfect circle of my retina No Gravity Watch Out! Hang Out! Fuck Off! Beyond! Out Yonder! Upsidedown I bleed on you so ease my pain, Blow Me Away You! Smash Up! wash away the blood from my body I see this halo of dust all around But my vision is clear I know I don't have any forces left To go the distance La dame des fauves I defy you, Artemis Shoot me between the eyes I want to face the day of reckoning Reunite, I want to embrace your light Implode, explode, both at the same time Destruction, let me disappear, fill my empty, Go to venus ('s) "
36,gojira,where dragons dwell,A deep voice is rising From the heart of the mountain Vibrations of the stone I can hear in my heart The call of instinct The flight of the powerful I hunger for it It just keeps me alive I met the dragon In a cave by the mountain Now I bring the evidence The beast is alive This ageless army Will strike in the morning And then a star will rise And shine in the sky But I grow impatient Cannot stand the wait And I start to dig Within me This tunnel to I In this region of me A great dragon is lying On the wealth of a mighty world My own world inside I saw I saw monsters And I And I started to dig within When I When I turn my back on them They devour me In this region of me A dragon is lying there Awake Monster Monsters kings Do not scorn them But do not fear them Muster Muster thy army Dragons are the myth alive In the heart of men 
37,gojira,remembrance,"I feel I come from better conditions buried deep in my mind I forgot awake my soul I want to find and drink this light Images of the past other lives and other places always the same embraces I return to where I've been I take inside a forward movement Involved in desire of consciousness progress, understand I want to find the keys of the past remember the past present future memory is a force so many things have happened to me the hardest of all But the gates would never again be opened to me unless I could bid them open at my own will and command I feel I come from better conditions (opened them at my own will and command) buried deep in my mind I forgot (opened them at my own will and command) always the same light, same embraces (opened them at my own will and command) I take inside a forward movement "
38,gojira,adoration for none,Everyone is doing their best to destroy it Simplicity's forgotten And we all drill the ground I stand free I refuse to be surrounded The stones and dust bite hostile devours flesh and bone The weakest lost in hatred Consequence is upon my door Responsible for my own life I'm reborn again and again Driven to increase my own power by creation the purest choice Destined to rule my life and go the way of the flesh Nature is my only master I will bow to no one The ground is dry like rock without any hope left But now I decide to grab my life with my hands Crave for freedom build my own life Adoration for none Reaction is a weakness the strong cannot afford My path is not determined by actions of others They fill themselves with hate Covering their faces blackened the wolves are back and crave to kill Slip on stones and break their legs Try to hide from termination But the time has come You will have to pay the debt of nature And now you are the one To change the face of the world You wield the sword the pain is left aside And I have left my tears behind me So I refind the way I that I know So bright to me And I only adore the fact that we are the creators of our own lives Lust for power is the master disease of our time This force alone devours the weak and rules the strongest So mired in convolution It chokes the life from your throat Break the chains of complication I breathe the air of freedom There is no room for your judgment My life is mine alone I purge myself of resentment I breathe the air of freedom Breathe... 
39,gojira,all the tears,"Are we left all alone? Mother has no time but she cares for me and she cried all the tears I am joining now the river flow I am three days old Now the time has come You have to be man I don't want to destroy the only chance I have to survive down here The wind blows I'm so scared and the waves so big, I'm not prepared I will have to be strong but for now I cry all the tears Now enter the storm and feel electric sword My entire life is about to burn I am struggling, life is illusion But I keep the dream of a better time This secret knowledge I receive from where I am So precious the treasured icons Extended to this point Forget the ones that hurt They all want, they struggle They fight and try to dry their tears We are all left on our own We are bound yet by each others lives Now I'm leaving this world I will never forget the river flow The pains and traps of life I put my scars away and love I have to face the truth of living I left my boat behind I am not taking it Where I go I won't be crying I die "
40,gojira,to sirius,"Now from a solar system To another I fly I come with life in my veins Through darkened space I ran I left a struggle behind And faced the fear that's alive I lost a world and traveled Straight across from the sky To find the gates of the heart  I come to Sirius C To learn from you friends of old And wish to come into being And behold I'm with you I am ready now to go The distance and even beyond Recover all my forces All the strength of the world And feel the light into me  From the strength of God We go to the power of Goddess This place is a throne For brightness The age of war is over  For God's sake They have never heard of you ""You'll never reach This master race"" Our force sickening Killing all the time Human laws Already slayed many lives  There was a streak of madness But now I know I see it's not the only truth The scars in me are opened Won't you please call me beyond  Crave affection love and courage Being courageous And flying instead of Falling down Follow these instructions I've been given In this dream awake  There is no goal to reach now Leviathans No complaint at all Dolphins from upper space Are in front of me In present they dwell  This is my way I've found my home My state of real There is no goal to reach This is my way"

42,gojira,on the bota,"Lost, a lion came and said: ""Come, on the brink of the abyss"" Watch my feet swinging in the great empty one Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades c'etait un palais infini No one else is able now to play with the answers And I open, my mind is so clear There's a door in the wall of time... "
43,gojira,wisdom comes,he who learns must suffer and even in our sleep pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart and in our own despair against our will comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of god ease your pain i cannot with suffering i don't he who learns must suffer and even in our sleep pain falls drop by drop upon the heart against our will wisdom comes 
44,gojira,clone,"Clone Every Step you take is to the end Chaos, duplicate the human slaves Mother Nature so far away: Why? Perfect is the race you dream Right now, I make my choice Perfection you fake is not The soul, not a genetic code You fools, you ignoramuses Hatchery, the newborn to celebrate Ashes to ashes, I see respect in the dust Life is so perfect Now for the weak an abortion Celebrate perfection that grows The flesh, a gift of science The soul a fault of a god Life on its way to the state of fire From the cold taste of steel Light embraces the dark, lava flowing free and the cradle is... Forgot the reasons why - We all lie so pale On the playground of cold Mother Nature is at saturation point and the cradle is falling down... "
45,gojira,explosia,"Jealousy will crush you to the bones Unless you open up and let it go I've only seen too much of it I'm bursting open while you set the tone You ignored this fury too long, I explode Bring back to life this anger, let it grow Put aside mind traps and false beliefs These heavy weights created pull you down The mask you wear is falling Try on and watch it fall Hands down you feel the moment Releasing out a lifetime All prayers to these gods While the tide is growing high Will you make us stronger When you strike us down? "
46,gojira,indians,"Ride a horse that's cleaving through the air and space of dreams travelling through time All alone I pray where am I? Who am I? And that old man trust in me His words are running now because we have lost all guides you're extended now to a world of light you're not the one you think you are since you were born you're only love On a mount I'm standing now and it's coming over me that I'm not here, I am on another plane humping around, hit myself I returned inside of me tears sliding down my face (I die again) And the horse is leaving me running out of space running out of reach you're not the one you think you are since you were born an Indian tribe "
47,gojira,fire is everything,"As I fight, trying to escape Covering my soul Watching the flames I must understand this wizard Fire is everything It burns, I provoke, It's beyond I feel, I create light Hypnotizing power I can't resist Reach out my hands, I feel the light Increase flames, the heat is oppressive Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in... Enter now so deep the flames, I respect the silence Overcome with cold I pray I see all the trees, the sky the grass, the oceans I embrace the world below And I know now all the reasons and all the countries Fire begins and fire ends Oh it burns, fire is all... "
48,gojira,a sight to behold,"Reflecting ourselves in the blood of all the beings we slay Misunderstand each other, out of control we remain There is a mystery, we're facing a sight to behold This is what we make of the world, we throw everything away The way we all behave is not understandable It is so sad to see the wealth of our planet fade away We all behave like children, taking off the head of our teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back We drain the oceans and suck all the blood out of the soil We spend the time we have left fighting and killing each other Lust for comfort, entertainment becomes an obsession And there is so much time to kill The way I see things is so simple The fact I'm walking standing on this land Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying The living creatures on our side The way I see myself so confused so sophisticated I have to stay away from me But I still don't get the point What's worth destroying all the worlds Try not to get it anymore You burn yourself, set fire for good We die eyes closed, dig our own grave now Tossed in the blaze naked on the flame Lost with no pride, drowned in the filth The giant snake is coming down to eat our heads and the flood will kill us, Mantus is rising from under The way I see things is so simple The fact I'm living dying on this land Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying The living creatures on our side The way I see myself so confused so sophisticated Don't have to stay away from me But I still don't get the point What's worth destroying all the worlds Try not to get it anymore Try not to get it anymore Try not to get it anymore Try not to get it anymore "

50,gojira,deliverance,"Your words are so cold to me Indisposed, don't hear your orders Destroy the greatness of soul Normalize what's in your hands Take a look from the future Get up from your dream and see Deliverance soon is coming For those who know I take a sword in my hand now I fight & kill Thanatos Feel the ground under your feet The roots so deep Every step I chose to make was just a kind of torture I changed my ways Now positive the fear became Can't control my arms Emergy too strong, I feel Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside For those who know, I want to be as clear, as real, as I protect Nothingness is all around I hate the taste of your words Every step I chose to make was just a kind of torture I changed my ways Now positive the fear became I hate the taste of my lost illusions I choose to live for the only reasons I felt on the ground I want to try "

52,gojira,wolf down the earth,"First of all you will eat all the bodies No matter they pray for freedom they'll kill you Forward you crush those going backward The wolves are now your lords Voracious flames upon the earth Second step you eat all the creation Swallow the trees the lakes and all the valleys Crush the moon, and drink the rivers flowing Deep rolling ocean blow Burning all that lives They teach you how to conquer and rule the world The towers that you built so strong, no man can touch They tell you how to find and raise the fears and let them grow inside of your heart they need no walls Is there a chance you face the void inside? Winds of doom will blow your pride away Behold the bright lights coming down on time Before these altars black, made from your sacrifice You take for granted what's been there for ages Inside the womb the new blood gets ready to fight The buildings of our fathers crumbling in dark vibrations Wolf down the one that made us all No hope, you wolf down the earth "
53,gojira,space time,"Space Time I fix my attention on this ball spinning round inside of me, deep inside Revolving conscious planet on an axis around this star By the light And the black holes in the vault of heaven make me wonder, wonder why How matter can disappear Are there doors in this wall to reach the light from time and space Now I see those mounts of fear feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity I can touch this wind of night that erases our light and makes us paranoiac But my legs are now so tired climbing all alone, all space, and all the time So I fix my attention now on this perfect planet revolving around this star And the sun, it seems so close I can touch the heat of presence and I know... I can see this monster light that embraces those notions: space and time The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why Light blackened? Door opened? Swim back time, door giving entrance to Supernova as only light Meet the earth and all the stars The entrance, the essence, supply us "
54,gojira,from mars,I just looked myself Straight in the eyes and saw That I had to move To higher places So I took my courage In both hands and I pushed off the ground With all my might Took off from the red place In the sky I fly I have lost my reason And I've made my sense From up there I will see Where I'm from And where the force of love Will tell me now to go But why do you say That you are lost If you don't even try To find yourself My words are a stair I put my feet on And I climb through A starless night to my place

The rage in their souls wait to attack Killing the child. The son of God shall burn. Crucifiers At one with the dark Defying the words of the world. At one with their rage Their numbers increase. Awaiting the lights judgement day, Exposing those who are opposed to the blade. The blood of the lamb spilled anointing the face. Screaming their words demanding moral decay Taken by force in darkness they find their way. Wage the war on life Suffocation of those who inhabit the light And crucify the worshippers. So they may die the same as their God Their screams in vain ring in my ears. Caressing my soul with their fears; Devourment consuming the blood. Their bodies are left for their God. Incinerate the enemy's flesh, Melted away by the burning force of the rage Which we possess. Growing inside the hatred, disgust and detest To be released on those who oppose Resist or try to defeat. The quest were on The strength of our numbers. Completely devouring all Defying the light. Burning inside No escaping the dark Destiny calls. Exposing those who are opposed to the blade, The blood of the lamb spilled anointing the face. Screaming their words demanding moral decay, Taken by force in darkness they find their way.

76,monstrosity,the angels venom,"Stagnant in this existence, I quest to free my mind. No longer captive This freedom my desire. My quest never ending With flames I light my path. Yet death impending, Shadows me on my way. So the quest consumes me As poison in my blood. Pulling my body downward Soon sleeping death shall come. And how the light it tempts me, I hear the trumpets call. Tasting the lips of angels, My soul is ripped apart. Lost, awake, yet dreaming. Asleep, yet conscious still, My soul extracted. I stumble through the dark. I have no vision, Yet I see everything. The essence coursing Ascension killing me. Burn, the angels venom raging through my veins. Violent hallucination venom draining me. The trumpets ringing the light begins to fade Into a new existence I am thrown again. Burning in distress and my body reeling, Traumatic visions form My mind erases Memories I'll never know. Listen to the screams of the souls in mourning Dissolving entity. Shown the ways of horror Writhing ecstasy. Burn the angels venom raging through my veins. Violent hallucination, venom draining me. The trumpets ringing the light begins to fade, Into a new existence I am thrown again. Hear the voices of the dying crying out to me. I hear the message clearly, voice of infinity Their words caress me and tell me of my end. Into the door of passage will I know flesh again? So the quest consumes me as poison in my blood, Pulling my body downward, sleeping death will come. Now the light it tempts me, I hear the trumpets call; Tasting the lips of angels my soul is ripped apart. By PhMetal "
77,monstrosity,perpetual war,"Stare in the face of this humanity; Frantic beings searching for their immortality. Hear the rage of the ending call And fight for life in the war on death. Perpetual War Fight Replenish mortal form Replaced with an artificial one. An illusion of continuance Life sustained only to be consumed. Strive to see the end of a mortal plague, Only to be defeated again. Discover cures, alter destiny Incubation of doom. Much more aggressively Burns in the fear of their passing on. Descent to darken oblivion To withstand the course of time, Is to deny the very fact that we die. Regression into the hands of disease we resist Fools imploring their Gods for regrets. Pray to idols for their sanity Yet ultimately reach submission. Into the hands of death we detest So surgery is performed. Open flesh for alteration To preserve our being. Pawns in perpetual war we engage. Stare in the face of this humanity Frantic beings searching for their immortality. Hear the rage of the ending call And fight for life in the perpetual war. The passion for the flesh And the burning desire we have to exist. Observe the weakness of our entity And in the quest for matter Become a casualty. Fight Replenish mortal form Replaced with an artificial one. An illusion of continuance Life sustained only to be consumed. "

The end of our time drawing near As displayed in the face of the tortured ones. Entombed in their graves Voices still screaming for salvation. That will never come As thousands more die, The screams remain For the ears of the living. Reminding them all of their death Hear their cries Hymns of tragedy. Rising from within the flames As the skin of the face slowly melts away The flesh becomes ash Screaming is ceased by the touch of death But those who have seen. Screams of the burning child Within their mind. The cries still ring, Suffering, waiting for death. Hear their cries Hymns of tragedy. "

So prepare to experience these methods first hand. Five repititious blows, Fracture the back of your skull, You are restrained and rendered motionless. Vomit spews from your mouth and nose As you convulse, your insides exposed For further excavation. Spread and disected, fading from consciousness Your blood soaked body skinned from head to toe.

Every entrail is consumed. Every entrail is consumed. None of your limbs shall go to waste. "

A divine intervention is underway to cleanse our burden of mistakes. Clouds transform into a mammoth storm as the skies blacken with ash. Downpours of sulfur nauseate and fill your chest. Overwhelming showers of flames cat through the flesh. Screaming like suffocated swine this is our punishment. Only few remain, for he's unsympathetic within his camaign.

Years passed on, nobody listened, nobody survived. Mankind's demise is reoccurring. Every succeeding generation is predestined to suffer. Until these voluminous hordes are satisfied or nothing is left to devour. The most insignificant of beings have rendered mankind helpless. This impending swarm harbors a catastrophic epidemic sweeping the coasts, invading your homes. Transmitting necrotizing fascistic, the aroma of fatal particulates infiltrate the senses, and form the altitudes they descend. Overwhelming multitudes of incessant arthropods fulminate from the sky engulfing everything in their path. Still they have an appetite. They're not satisfied. Still they are not satisfied.

Yet there are survivors scarce who hide amongst the ruins where a crucial decision must be made: To die of starvation or take ones life and feed upon their flesh. The sky won't expose any znswers to stop searching there. You cannot escape reality's trials with a simple prayer. For such a complicated sin fear not of punishment. Find enjoyment in their pain and incisions made. You're not a heathen for thinking this if God can allow these situations. With no response or a single sign sent from the heavens, is God deaf, or maybe dead? Is God deaf? God is not deaf, just nonexistent. Allow your last ounce of faith to diminish. Let the hunger consume your thoughts. For all the years spent on your knees finally stand to think without looking above, Finally you stand to think, without looking above. Desperated times call for desperate actions. So murder, consume, and repeat for survival in a devastated world of exile. This is a mandatory sacrifice "

The Challenge, To unlearn what they once knew, To not repeat the past with the same outcome. Soon the tribulations of few Shall return to haunt the many. Inherent lust for chaos and depravity. Returning is the lust for chaos and depravity. Returning is the lust for chaos and depravity. Returning is the lust for chaos and depravity. Returning is the lust for chaos and depravity.

The Devourer of souls, the acuser, who find satisfaction in their pain, This monumental destroyer awaits Aroused in anticipation for these black gates to open and unleash, implications of horror and bloodshed for our sins. Trading bloodshed for our sins, there is no salvation. There is no salvation. For he has risen to conquer us. He has risen to conquer us all. He shall destroy you, there is no saving you. "

Only known to the mother in guilt, as she stumbles from the alley covered in flies. With a ten mile stare dead to the world she never gave one fuck for the child inside... none. Sucks the crack pipe in shame just to forget. Yet with another hit, she's on the streets again in another life she once had hope. But that went down the drain. Along with her pride. Nurses habitually resigned. Tossing the carcass, in the waste bin death legally designed? Or fixing the future with quick extraction? Conceived and thrown away from womb into the waste.

Kill the killer they will say. Justice through murder goes both ways. Conceived and thrown away from womb into the waste. One more girl, mortified. Never knew what was growing within. Obese, diseased, down on her knees she gave birth on the toilet seat. Insert anesthetize. Late term feticide. Orphan spawned from rape. Short lived, half a face. Crackhead whore for host. Hatching living ghosts. Pregnant, drunk and high. It was no surprise, when she left it there to die. One more girl who could never conceive. Psychopath, maternity-mad. Took a steel bat to her mother's head, hacked her up and took the baby out. One more girl, six months in, takes a hanger and a bottle of pills. The pro-life priest has nothing to say as the embryo's scraped away. Straight into the trash with the unborn offspring, generations dead in time, progeny unwanted.

Come and see the doctor, Strangelove is here. No other superpower means nothing to fear. Who needs a fucking treaty, when we got guns. Fuck the little countries, lets have some fun.

There was a time, when the weak would suffer. The ones in power would crush all who dissent. Just look around, because nothing's changed. No longer kings, they wear a suit and tie. Those who survive, have no conviction Just follow trends, until they're born again. So who will live, and who will die? It's up to us to carry on the fight. Rising up, from the ashes to the challenge. Face to face, it's not too late to start resisting. All around; we have a chance to change the world. Believe in us, tomorrow's dreams are fire in our blood. Bred to buy, not to think. Tell more lies, make them weak. Nothing's real, except the mindset you've created.

Handed down, the final call. Rise to fight, destroy them all. It's too late to accomodate. The game is lost, because no one is thinking.

Chemical children are raised in the streets, Their whoring mothers begging beside. In prisons the riots are breeding resistance The starving all seek to be fed. A shit-city built on the backs of the poor where the real world is buried beneath. While tourists and business, partners in greed devour the fruit of the land. Starving and dying, assassins surround to kill them. Praying for something or someone to set them free. Life in Babylon, post-A.D., defined in terms of what can you do for me. The world outside is full of rot, so walls divide the burn of acid air, and black-cloud skies. Death squads are crawling the city, in search of the worthless to fill up mass graves. Corrupted and careless, degrading all life these cops are the killers, well-trained. Millions of people stand dead at their feet, begging for mercy denied. Breathing pollution and slaving to eat, they're humans, but empty inside. Rise, out of the slums, they seek to fight, fight to defend. Nothing is left but a future of death. Awaiting the poor, who starve just to breathe. Breathe in the air, now they shall be reborn. How can you think that our world is so good? The red, white and blue blinds your eyes. When everything's fine in your white neighborhood, who cares for the dying outside? Forced to rebellion, uprising they're tearing through the walls of confinement, uprooted The promise of a third world resistance, the power is overtaken. Nightfall in Sodom, it's burning. It's time to bring it down. Now the time has come at last, to give back what they demand. Just a chance for life, and peace far away from famine and disease. Power has changed across the world now, It's just the money that rules in Sodom today. And the bastards that run the corporate plan, will be choking on their blood when the masses make them pay. "

In this latest chapter, whilst naively excavating in the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka, we have unwittingly awakened our protagonist from his long, restful interment. After wreaking his underworld vengeance upon us for disturbing him from his oblivion, he is tormented by memories of the unholy transgressions that had caused him his anguished eternal entombment... in all seriousness, though, I sometimes get the uneasy feeling that perhaps it would be best to leave Lovecraft's characters sleeping, undisturbed in an eternal dormant state - dead, as it were, but dreaming. Who knows what we might awaken?] "

He is said to have lived from 2375 to 2345 B.C., but some Egyptologists date him as far back as 5330 B.C. The internal structure of his pyramid is known for incorporating several innovative features, but is most recognized for the inclusion of vertical lines of hieroglyphs on the walls of the vestibule and burial chamber. When Maspero opened the Unas pyramid in 1881, he found texts covering these stone walls to be extremely difficult to decipher, because of their archais characters, forms, and spellings. These were magickal/religious texts, designed to ensure the safe passage of the Pharaoh into the next world. They are known today as the ""Pyramid Texts."" According to these texts, Unas became great by eating the flesh of his mortal enemies and then slaying and devouring the gods themselves. Those gods that were old and worn out (Egyptian gods aged and died) were used as fuel for Unas's fire. After devouring the gods and absorbing their spirits and powers, Unas journeys through the day and night sky to become the star Sabu, or Orion. While this is certainly not the first reference to cannibalism in Old Kingdom texts, what is notable is the method by which the Pharaoh Unas achieves deification and immortality; by turning on the gods, slaying and then devouring them, and thus ascending to the heavens to become the star Orion. The concept was remarkable to Maspero, who found the idea to be of ""absolute savagery."" Maspero seemed to be reeling from a confrontation with a symbolic revival of pre-dynastic cannibalistic rites - which are suggested, according to Maspero, by the gnamed and disconnected bones found in certain early graves. Professor Petrie suggests that at the original Sed festival, the tribal king appears to have been sacrificed and devoured, so that his people might derive from his flesh and blood the power and virtues which made him great. This practise was based on a belief in contagious magick. Bulls and boars were eaten to give men strength and courage, deer to give fleetness of foot, and serpents to give cunning. The blood of slain and wounded warriors was drunk so that their skill and bravery might be imparted t the drinkers. Similarly, Unas feasts after death on the spirits of the gods, and on the bodies of men and gods. He swallows their spirits, souls, and names, which are contained in their hearts, livers, and entrails, thus, Unas becomes allpowerful. In attempting to bring this epic-length text to song from, it was necessary to make some minor concessions, firstly, that every version I have at home of the text is translated somewhat differently, and thus there is not any singularly definitive versions; and secondly, that it would just not be possible to include every last line from the original text. That would probably necessitate a song inconceivable in length. As it is, in concise song lyric form, ""Unas Slayer of the Gods"" weighs in at about 12 minutes plus - and that is using what would be considered only the bare minimum essential lines for the development and presentation of the main aspects of the text. For those interested in reading the entire work, there are several versions readily available online or by ordering from a local bookstore. I typed in ""Unas Slayer of the Gods"" in a couple of search engines and was astounded at the number of results that came back.] "

The story takes place in the latter half of the 14th Dynasty, and is about a struggle to restore the majesty of the Pharaoh of Pharaohs. Tanus, leader of the mighties army of Egypt, the Blue Crocodile Regiment, hunted down and destroyed the Shrikes, a horrid nomadic tribe of thieves, rapists, and murderers that played the Egyptians. The title of the song, ""Wind of Horus,"" refers to the name of the boat of the Blue Crocodile Regiment. It is an enchantment of the god Horus to cause the wind to blow the Egyptians' sails in time of need. The repeated chant in the song is to invoke the god Ashu, who robs the enemies of the Egyptians of their virtues, weakening and destroying them. The word Lanata is mentioned in the song. Lanata was a bow made for Tanus by Taita the slave and was made of wood, ebony, rhinocerus horn, and ivory tusks. The bowstring was made out of the guts of a lion that Tanus had killed with his bronze-bladed war spear. Tanus was probably the only one in his army strong enough to use the Lanata bow. It had so much tension that he had to use a different technique just to pull the bowsting back. Tanus practised until he could shoot three arrows at a time piercing the heaviest of armor.] "

The scenes depicted in this chapter describe some of the tortures which are inflicted upon the original enemies of Osiris. It is impossible for Osiris to slay all of his enemies at once, even though they are in his power. While various batches of them are awaiting their turn at the Block of Slaughter, they are kept tightly fettered and bound. One of the forms of the torture depicted described the ""Kheftin Asar Butchiu,"" i.e., the enemies of Osiris who are to be burned.

Entitled, ""The Chapter for Bringing Heka to those who Burn,"" the author claimed it was part of a larger collection of works known as ""The Book of Resurrection Apophis."" In Egyptian methology, Apophis is also known as Apep, the terrible monster serpent who, in dynastic times, was a personification of the darkness of the darkest hour of night. Apeop is the dreaded embodiment of utter evil in the form of a giant snake that arises anew each night to struggle against the Sun god, Ra. Against Apep, Ra must not only fight, but must succesfully conquer morning sun, lest darkness and chaos engulf the entire earth during the day as well. Apep was both crafty and evil doing, and, like Ra, possessed many names, to destroy him it was necessary to curse him by each and every name by which he as known. In Egyptian papyri, Apep is also represented in the form of an enormous serpent, into each undulation of which a knife is stuck. In the Book of Gates, we see him fastened by the neck with a chain (along which is fastened the Goddess, Serqet), the end of which is in the hands of a god, and also chained to the ground with five chains. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), Apophis is also the name the Hyskos king Aussere adopted during his reign over the conquered and subjugated Egypt of 1570 B.C. The Hyskos had invaded Egypt and established their new political and religious capical city, Avaris, in the delta region of Egypt. Avaris is also the site of the original Temple of Set. Set (or Sutekh, to the Hyskos) wa the chief god of the Hyskos at that time, but in Egyptian mythology since pre-dynastic times, Set was the murderous brother of Osiris, and the original ultimate embodiment of the forces of darkness, chaos and evil, at whose command was te monster serpent, Apep. During the early period of the Hyskos occupation, the Hyskos faced little significant opposition. But during the reign of Apophis I, the Theban princes of Egypt rose up to drive the Hyskos back out of Egypt, a feat that is recounted on two large stelae set up by Kamose in the Temple of Amun at Karnak. The text which I received was in three languages - Egyptian, Greek and modern English, along with rubric instructions for the proper recitation of the chants, which are to be memorized and repeated as a sort of mantra, and as such should be spoken in Egyptian rather than English. The translations were given only to throw light upon the meanings of the spell. Upon closer examination of the text, it seems to bear superficial resemblance to Chapter 24 of the Papyrus of Ani, ""The Chapter for Bringing Magick to Ani,"" (which is also known in some Books of the Dead as ""The Chapter for Gaining Power,"" and in modern ritualmagick as ""The Gathering of Heka."") But the similarities go immediately astray, for ""The Chapter for Bringing Heka to those who Burn"" seems as though it is, in this incarnation, a blasphemous underworld perversion of the chapters contained in the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead. Perhaps it was intended for use by ancient cultists who would be intent upon using the darker forces of Chaos and the spiritual energy of those souls burning in the fiery pits of torment in the underworld for their own cultist ambitions of the upsetting the orderer structure of the ancient Egyptian world. More likely, their goal was probably to alter the political balance of rival religious factions in the turmoil of those tumultuous intermediate times. By the end of the 14th Dynasty, Egypt's once considerable might as a nation had eroded due to internal political struggles, so that it was unable to defent itself against invaders. The Hyskos overwhelmed the Dynasty, remaining in power until being expelled during the 17th Dynasty ina great war, which lasted, according to Manetbo, about a quarter of a century.] "

Lovecraft, and to a lesser degree, Robert E. Howard. It tills the story of a rebellions Serpent cult who are plotting to overthrow Pharonic rule. They are attempting to raise the spirits of the ancient dead, to barness thei arcane knowledge and build an army of undead legions. The story takes place within the subterranean main ch.mber of the crypts of mummified reptiles (true enough, archaeologists have indeed unearthed entire necropolises containing thousand of mummified crocodiles, serpents, ancient Nile monitor lizards, and various other animals that were worshiped as personifications of the gods they represented). Within these dark and bloodstained halls are not only the remains of three millenia of generations of priests and worshippers, but also the mummified corpses of all manner of glorified reptilian deities. The leader of these rebels is standing in the midst of this vast array of Saurian entombment, inciting insurrection and preparing for some sort of violent revolution. Their ill-fated sedition comes to naught, however, when their temple is destroyed and they are all slain in a catastrophic violent climax. Whether this is perhaps divine intervention and retribution by the Sun god, Ra, or perhaps military action by the armies of the Pharaoh (who is a worshipper of Ra) putting down a violent rebellion, or merely the indiscriminate vengeance of the undead that the conspirators were seeking to enslave, is unclear. The passage that tells of the descruction and demise of the rebel fiends is reminiscent of the magickal/religious ceremony in The Book of Overthrowing Apep, in which the terrible monster serpent Apep is forever crushed by the Sun god, Ra, nver to rise up again. In the aftermath, all that is left of the Temple, the Serpent Cult and their subterranean catacombs of the tombs is a mass of rubble and forgotten ruins which are eventually covered over by the sands of time, explainined in a passage that borrows quite literally from The Nameless City by H.P. Lovecraft.] "

Such objects survive to this day usually only when they are buried as a part of a rite, and usually in the vicinity of a tomb or necropolis. Archeologist have found the remains of such rites at the royal cemetaries of Giza, Saqqarra, Lisht, and at several forts in Nubia. Stone, wax, or mud figures, or broken clay tablets or clay pots, are inscribed with lists of the enemies of Egypt. The body of the figure is usually flattened to make room for the text, or sometimes a papyrus is inserted inside the body cavity. On the back, the arms, or the arms and legs, are bound together. The inscriptions found on them are called ""execration texts."" These texts threaten death to specific people. Often, they include the name, parentage, and title of war. The execration texts were mainly aimed at enemy rulers, hostile nations, and tribes in Nubia, Libya, and Syria-Palestine. Magickal incantations and rites were used to cause death and suffering, and to prevent the angry spirits of the executed from taking vengeance on those who had condemned them. Usually included in these texts are long-standing enemies of those involved in the cursing rites. There is also often a catchball phrase against any man, woman, or eunuch who might be plotting rebellion. Amongst the common people, the execration rituals were carried out after the killing of a personal enemy or the execution of criminals. By killing the enemy's name, which was an integral part of the personality, this rite would extend the punishment into the afterlife. The spirits of defeated enemies or executed traitors were regarded as a continued supernatural threat, which needed to be met with magic. The wording of the texts is similar to that of contemporary spells on papyrus, which promise to protect against the malice of demons and ghosts. Those named in the execration texts are referred to as ""mut"" - the dangerous dead. It is also the word used to describe the troublesome dead in protective spells for private persons. The stone figures and red clay pots on which the execration texts were written were ritually broken as part of the cursing ceremony in order to smash the enemy's power. A pit near the Egyptian fort of Mirgissa in Nubia contained hundreds of such pot shards, as well as over 350 figures. Deposite of figures have been found outside fortresses, tombs, and funerary temples. The clay figures were burned and then buried with iron spikes driven through them, or nailed to the outer walls, as the bodies of executed traitors and foreign enemies sometimes were. The more eloborate enemy figures were sometimes trussed up like animals about to be sacrificed. Some are shown with their throats cut, the method used to kill sacrificial animals. The dismembered body of a Nubian and a flint sacrificial knife were found nar the Mirgissa pit. Some Egyptologists believe that human sacrifices routinely accompanied execration rituals, while others have argued that the figures were normally a substitute for such sacrifices.] "

417,nile,the blessed dead,"Looked Down Upong With Scorn We Work the Fields of the Masters And Share Not the Bounty of the Black Earth Destitute Servile Cast Out Affording No Tomb We Shall Be Buried Unprepared in the Sand We Shall Never Be The Blessed Dead Scorned By Asar Condemned at the Weighing of the Heart We are Exiled from the Netherworld Serpents fall Upon us Dragging us Away Ammitt Who Teareth the Wicked to Pieces Pale Shades of the UnBlessed Dead None Shall Enter Without the Knowledge Of the Magickal Formulas Which is Given to Few to Possess Not for Us to Sekhet Aaru Our Souls Will be Cut to Pieces with Sharp Knives Tortured Devoured Consumed in Everlasting Flames We Shall Never Be The Blessed Dead [The phrase, ""the Blessed Dead,"" is a reference to those who obtain the ""blessed"" condition in the afterlife: the beautified condition of eternal lifein the presence of Osiris in the Sekbet-Aaru, or ""Field of Reeds."" Those who had lived a moral life, observed the proper burial rites and procedures, and possessed all the correct magickal spells to navigate the treacherous and horrific Egyptian underworld, who could recite the 42 negative confessions, and whose hearts were found to be pure at the ""Weighing of the Heart,"" were then allowed to be ""Osirified"" - to become a person like as unto Osiris - and enjoy a pleasant afterlife as ne of the blessed dead.] [Proper burial, though, was an expensive undertaking. It was usually afforded only by pharaohs, priests, and the wealthy class. What of those who could not afford the extravagant tombs, mummification, magickal amulets, and costly papurys texts on which were written the necessary spells for successfully navigating the underworld? Even linen, which was used to wrap the mummies, was so expensive in ancient Egypt that people had to save what little scraps of it they could for years to have enough to have themselves wrapped. Also of mention would be the cost of professional mourners, embalmers, and priests for the ""Opening of the Mouth"" ceremony. This was all extremely expensive. Even a wealthy person in ancient Egypt would spend a lifetime saving and preparing for his or her burial and afterlife. I suppose it is no small coincidence that the religious priests were directly involved in the embalming industry.] [But what of the middle and lover classes of people - the common working man? What then of the slaves and servant classes? if all these costly preparations and arcane knowledege were essential to achieving a state of blessedness in the afterlife, would a person of limited financial means be condemned beforehand to burn in torment in the afterlife, so only the wealthy became the Blessed Dead? While most of the populate certainly accepted this fatalistic concept - and by all that we know of ancient Egypt, embraced life and the hope of an eternal afterlife - most ancient Egyptians probably were resigned to do whatever funereal preparations were within their means It stands to reason, however, that certainly some small number of lower income / slave / working class people (predestined, of course, to certain financial / spiritual doom, as upward caste mobility was very limited in ancient times) would be less than inclined to accept at face value the idea that, no matter what, by the end of their lives they would not be able to afford to be buried as one of the blessed dead. Would they be resigned to their eternal fate, or live their lives with subversive viewpoints - perhaps rebelling against the established religious order, or perhaps choosing to worship amongst the pletbora of ""other gods"" of the Egyptian pantheon? (Budge refers to them as, ""Wretched little gods."")] [Certainly the existence of the ancient cult worship of the god, Set, is not without some sort of seditious causality. Perhaps these, then, are the countless legions of souls damned to fiery pits of torment in the underworld: the ""Hated of Ra"" or ""Enemies of Osiris."" This probably would also liken these wretched and lost souls to be followers of Set and his Seban fiends, who were the original enemies of Osiris and precursor role models on which later religious based their ideas of ""Hell"" and ""Satan"" and his ""infernal legions."" I am reminded of John Milton, who, in Paradise Lost, wrote of Lucifer, after he had been cast down and came to realization of his unrepentant autonomy, ""It is better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven."" And thus, that brings us full circle to the chorus refrain of ""The Blessed Dead."" complete with infernal choirs of the underworld defiantly proclaiming, ""We Shall Never Be The Blessed Dead.""] "

A fluid, limbless, sickening shape, a faltering semi-floating cluster. Its sole purpose of creation; To burst the imagination blood surge. Defying the mould of human flesh. Smashing the wall of beliefs. A sight to bring insanity to all dimensional reality. Carved from thoughts unthought into a graphic, visible delusion of life. A twisted display of dehumanized features, by cells reflected, refracted. A frantic dancing of particles, in pathetic attempt at rendering flesh; Swirling to project the illusion of shape, form, dimension and mass. (Eyes not made for watching. Thousand watt obsidian bulbs; Reflective, obversed. The only view is the barren self) A walking translucent entity. Void, suspended. Inviolate by rules, all standards of existence. An electrified vapor-cloud. A skein of bone and tissue. An atrocity, a liquid form unshaped to the organic norm. A mind not filled with thoughts, but a random flickering static. A soulless creature un-alive; I'm the un-human elastic. "

We destroy all we create We'd rather send death and debt to our future Than love and technology. We live in a society with a fever for physical death or it don't exist.

920,cephalic carnage,misguided,"Only child, with an imaginary friend, always lonely Sheltered and frail, emotionally ill. Mother will smother you, father left because of who? Somehow you are to blame An outsider looking in! Overly loved, verbally abused Never wants to go home! Now you live in your head! Your own reality Everyone else is dead! Lack the skills to communicate, no friends Bullies, abuse, suicidal, gravely depressed Never can do wrong in the eyes of mom. Severely misguided, my life is a lie, no tears left, now I'll die!

921,cephalic carnage,lucid interval,"You are paranoid, with delusions of grandeur Somehow things ain't right, there's an imbalance in your mind Chain reflex is slow, anxiety neuroses set in. Breaking out in sweat, was it something that I said? Is your asthma flaring up? Why are you so pale? Hands are livid from punching holes in the wall. (Thinking someone is in your brain.) You never take your medicine, that's you're always sick! Looking so afraid, should I call your mom, I'm talking to myself, answer me, stop shaking. Waiting from the ambulance, to get your some help The deranged look you have, you will cut yourself Don't grab that knife! Why are you amputating me? I am your second personality! Suicide is not the alternative! If your trephinate I will not die, we can live together, Conjoined at the cephalic. I command you to obey. Don't try to kill me, I have my own life, To separate, will be our demise! Smoke some weed and relax! You're going thru a great deal of stress. Fetid breath reeks, go brush your teeth, You should get clean, your hair is full of grease! This is a song about a man, with an unnatural appendage at the skull. When they have no weed they go insane, now they are stoned and get along. A lucid interval will straighten this place out Fighting you tore down the walls. "
922,cephalic carnage,arsonist saviur,"Growing up a lonely kid Blaine had an infatuation with fire Stealing lighters, matches, whatever he could get Pyromaniacal son of an architect, working hard Pioneering buildings that would not burn Gained praise from his colleagues Never anytime for a wife and son. This would make Blaine mad The ill neglect from his mom and dad Infuriates him to see blood red The only relief from the pain. Ignite up the night sky Tears inside, pain subsides Watch the structure fall, immolate us all His destructive hate, burnt the whole block down. And it felt so good, gotta get away Before I get caught Worst case of arson the city ever saw Policeman arrives so many casualties All my family died! Incinerating my house and everything inside Paramedics could not save their lives Fire struck while everyone was sleeping Heaps of seared flesh, I was I were dreaming I burned my pain away Now that Blaine has grown, living on his own High school graduate, valedictorian Becomes a fire man, to cleanse his soul. But the arsonist in his mind is still alive, urging him on! Starting fires again building structures descend And saving lives how I have to pretend I am a humanitarian Hypocrite that I am From my father I inherited the gift to invent time-ignited fires At buildings of my choice Then I sit back and wait, for the emergency call from 911 Sirens sound, burning down the hospital and stadium, Both at the same time. Arriving at the catastrophe, I see victims around me baked Many souls have I taken away. I work franticly to douse the flames, moving diligent I start to cry, hundreds wounded! "

I was astray And though it was day The sun shone no more But as I despaired Certain to be lost I suddenly stood By a temple The temple in my dreams With a thousand steps My journey was complete The source of essence Of which I had been foretold Climbing up the stairs Hewn in stone Stained with generations blood Thorn, like poison snakes Entangles me, severs my skin Helped by the wind At last at the top A mysterious sight reaches my eyes For on the very highest step A gigantic mirror was placed Unseen in my dream I was dismayed With fear I faced the mirror And to my great surprise My reflection... The image of the devil And behind... At the very foot of the stairs I could see clouds And heaven from above Through the mirror I could see heaven's gate Forever closed for me All of a sudden A stormwind came And put the mirror in spin Got hold of the thorn Of the highest step I see the mirror stop Yet the wind blows My image... I am Messiah Hanging down the stairs In the reflection a chasm And the gate in front of me Was the back of the gate to hell I was sure to fall A question of seconds But once again The wind came to my help And saved me from the flames But trapped in the grasp of the wind I was violently thrown Towards the spinning mirror And I got caught in the spin New dimensions I saw But I never say the mirror again My last way to redemption Turned out to be a fatal delusion I'm condemned To eternal emptiness Condemned to play roles In a thousand worlds I'm never to be myself again (Leads by: Schalin) (Final lead part two by: Allenmark) "

I Hear no rescue squads They can't hear my silent screams Or does this have to be; I deserve to die? Mi9s-grown fate can't be stopped It's harvest-time And I did invite The Reaper To help me with the crop I used to be an observing satellite Sent here without a task Collecting images That I'd never supply When a lost satellite crashes and burns No one cries We only know our own world And can't do otherwise I blame no one But wish that I, on this ship Had dared to believe The navigator has always been me Under the debris There's still life but for how long? I hear no rescue squads They can't hear my silent screams "
961,anata,let the heavens hate,"Deep inside a black heart A mourning shadow grows Wolves in their chains growl Moaning at the azure skies Dreaming of a dark past When the strong would reign in savagery Let us burn our Christian ties Let us arise again Let the heavens hate!

Reversing the evolution of that universe itself! Using, advanced quantum physics and light frequency radiation to achieve the task. Accidentally covering the mysteries of time, but believing it to be true celestial intervention. Theories, when, exercised, will follow a destructive path. Transgressing timelines and interfering in matters of dimensional construct... The Objective: To find the dawn of time itself and prevent it from commencing! Only then will they reach. Their goal... Omnipotence! A fascinating presumption, that only time will reveal... "
1011,psycroptic,merchants of deceit,"They were watching... Listening Ever patient awaiting the time. For they knew it would come it has always been so. Thus, forward they came... An appeal to the heavens, spoken an age ago. Pleading for answers, offering all that was possessed. Shaman: scholars of the time close to the answer, Incapable of reaching perfect enlightenment - Yet, help they would receive, at a price so immense, ambitious and selfish... A mistake they should not have made. Our ancestors- our past has become our demise. Our ancestral representatives celebrated the arrival The visitors from the sky... Joyous with the knowledge that their appeal had been answered. These visitors - describing themselves as celestial gatherers, traders, explorers. A half truth. Masking the deception beneath. Offering answers... Knowledge and Truth... But at a price, A fair exchange... They requested life... Aghast... Apprehensive... The forefathers refused. Negotiating; the travellers explained that it would not be their lives; Not those of the present era. It Would be the future populous: An age away: An age beyond imagination... Our age. Nervously an agreement was made. The celestial ones prepared to reveal their knowledge with the select few to do with as they saw fit. The chosen, schooled by the visitors from the sky not foreseeing the knowledge that lag ahead Not foreseeing the knowledge they would learn... Unable to be purged from their mind... Irreversible. Departing, the travellers were seen no more. The selected were left with knowledge unimaginable. Disturbed, overwhelmed - no choice but to cease their own existence. Their lives had become futile, with their infinite comprehension. Lives forfeit by their own trembling hands. Blood spilled instead of answers... Long forgotten... Unaware that we must uphold this pact... A deal that exists despite the weakest of principals They will fulfil a bizarre religious crusade. We belong to the celestial ones: The harvesters of the foolish... Traders and gatherers they are: cunning in their methods. Exchanging what is required fur their spiritual needs our lives... Any life unworthy... Must be halted. Sustaining their faith. The unworthy are those who mishandle true insight. Betraying their future our planet, placed in total stasis... With no meaningful continuation. Like countless before, and endless to come. This is how it will continue... To save their own being. Giving a function, a purpose to their all-knowing lives. This is their belief... to weed out the feeble in the cosmos Those who do not learn should not progress... Those without understanding should not continue... "

Yet, this time it's different - confused, undisciplined! They are of the same origin - this you can somehow feel how and why is unclear, Intense is the stench of the paranoia within, sickened to your core, Leaving your senses numb in parallel Fearing sleep - it will happen once again The ongoing. Dissolution of your sanity. Thoughts that aren't your own rage inside gout head, gradually cleansing the singularity you possess... A hierarchy broken: disordered they wander. Without purpose... reason... method. Not in body... but in mind - a blueprint of mental ambiguity. Fallen: their sovereign the flawless one Minion of the fallen. Once easily controlled - weak of will, strong of mind Chosen for the telekinetic qualities they posses. Helping to cure man... To mend all that is flawed Cultivated in clandestine, groomed for the chores that lay ahead. It is a noble pursuit to heal the sick... Yet not of an ailment they would desire to keep Their own singularity... Left without guidance to pave a now disordered path. Minds scatted by the pursuit of absolute perfection, Moulded by the environment in which was so pure. Previously free to sculpt others in their own glorious image, Under the watchful and ever present master's gaze. Carefully reordering the subliminal traits of the countless blemished psyche. Maintaining a balance, a cure for the ailing. 'they mast be changed for the good of all. ' Independence of mind is an unacceptable outcome. It is not perfect, not pure. A pursuit neither 'good' nor 'evil'... no more With his falling. All guidance is lost. The fallen one, so convinced; determined to repair what has been eternally flawed: The Human Race. Conquered by the defect of his own mortality. Unguided... Untamed... Unstopped... One thought with an infinity of voices. No balance in the human form. Stopped. This will return us to zero when it is finished, how are we to continue? For we will he only one - the same mind in a multitude of bodies "
1013,psycroptic,missionaries of a future to come,"I am now complete... How could I have possibly existed like this before? Such an unproductive method of being. Stripped of all surplus, all that is needed and meaningless. Changed for the positive... I recall resisting the change at first. Due to the influence of the malicious enthrallment of mind: Now uncontaminated. I understand precisely... I am now aware that this is the only legitimate method of life, Such a change commands a new responsibility, a commitment unwavering, I must fulfil the requirements of this gift: as I am returned to my intended existence... How I was supposed to be created... How we all once were going to be... It was irrational not to replace limbs, beliefs and feelings that were obsolete. It was irrational not to help others with the change... With improvement viable, no reason existed to not attain. However, human emotions, did not advance, they resisted... This outdated reasoning had to be restructured by force... We were to share it with the cosmos; to make the universe perfect... efficient. Eager to spread the future. The majority of our kin left this world to begin anew. Leaving a small number behind to finish the required amendments to the primitives. Close to completion, the dissidents resisted. They spread the illness; irrational emotions began to resurface within us. Confused, we halted our task. Some of us fought each other. Some of us self dismantled. Collectively, we failed. The dissidents halted the magnificent progress. Reverting to ways of old. To the basic natural ways: to the organic traditions. Enslaving all inhabitants: forcing their ideals of sovereignty. Their dreams of individuality became a reality... Striping away achievements, leaving a disgusting way of being. Self importance stopped what we all had worked for. Their forced epidemic stripped us all of our resolve... We all had a purpose, to advance and re-create. It was taken... All due to the un-suppression of meaningless emotions buried within. Now we re-emerge, an age on... As missionaries of the future to come. I am the first to be given the gift here, albeit offering resistance at first, My primitive mind, limiting my vision. My kin returning from worlds beyond. To see an archaic land still existing. This time we have an obligation to succeed. "
1014,psycroptic,netherworld reality,"Waking in the morning, affected by your sleep, Your vision is blurred, you can't feel your feet. Your body is cold, you don't feel quite right, You cannot what happened during the - night You get off the floor- trying to stand, it is so hard. Your circulation, seems to have stopped, what's going on? You feel your way- to wash your face- It takes forever On the way you fall down, straight onto something wet. It smells like blood, a smell you can never forget. You stand up again- you're nearly there But you cannot see- or feel your legs But you know you are close- living there all these years But now you enter, the room you seek Hoping that water will help you see You stumble across the room. The effort has left you weak. You search blindly and finally turn the faucets on, Underneath you hold your hands, Then splash it on your face Panic flows within- something's not right. You can only see from one eye- You think that's because there's just one. You turn around to find the mirror on the wall, The reflection makes you retch, ""what the- fuck is Going - on here?"" You scream. Then a memory from the night before Makes you look down at the gun on the floor Standing there with half a head You wonder why you just didn't stay dead. "
1015,psycroptic,of dull eyes borne,"Have you ever asked yourself what is the purpose of life- Why is our history so unproven Why is there so many different stories of evolution Some may believe we evolved from primates But others say that God created Adam and Eve There are some who believe we were created from the soil. I say no to this We were created by aliens as was our entire world For them we- are just an experiment To be used by the aliens for scientific purposes They gave us- such desire- so we are- The creatures most likely to ruin our environment They created all things, equal in the beginning (but) throughout history, changed our psyches Now the human race has lost it's every bit of dignity Killing fellow beings as many die in poverty Self obsessed people are the downfall of society Aliens are impressed by our suicide ability. -Bastards- Pulling on our puppet strings and Laughing as we scream and cry They are watching us intently through the darkened skies Picking us at random to abduct and take samples from They're recording our moves chronologically Think of all the things we don't know about life Like why our skin colours range between black and white Why are there different languages spoken in different countries Why do we hate our 'brothers'. we- all- bleed- red- So do the animals we kill, for our game and for our meal Why do we kill all those that we consider below ourselves What is with our society We are selfish creatures, that are controlled by injections From these dull eyed beings Those of grey are masters of our life We delude ourselves that we are in control We are simple lifeforms, we have low intelligence We are nothing more than aliens' pets We make aimless journeys, just to visit places we've seen In some glossy brochure or on a screen See the lights in the sky at night, what are they? You stop and stare, you are paralysed by a blinding light Wake up- on steel, you are lying on your back Held down- with clamps, there's a machine above you Alien- device, testing the threshold of your pain Pierces- your eyes, with a fine needle Feel their presence, they're standing along side you Operating the machine, preparing more tests to go They do not have mercy, they see it as a sin They start to drill, inside your cerebrum -you- cannot cry- forced- submission- They force a needle into you and You drift back to where you were While they cut you finely and Inspect every part for contaminants That you've induced so they can make new poisons For the next human, on which they experiment.

1016,psycroptic,our evolutionary architecture,"A virus unnoticed. Now ingrained in us all For we are not what we appear to be... This is the fundamental nature of the syndrome. A plague presenting a new means of being: of which has never been witnessed. Nothing. To alleviate the effect... Oblivious, relieved of our true awareness; replaced with a new script for our futures: Puppets for a twisted play. With humanity as the lead. Spread with such an aggressive velocity: Concealed within the natural magnetic properties of the earth. A unique catalyst: an efficient method to spread infection. We were all contaminated within an instant... The entire populous: with no immunity... Our bodies rendered void: our minds unaware. In harmony we fell where we stood... Motionless, switched into a dreamlike state. Our tangible existence replaced... Oblivious: we carry on with our now illusionary life. However, we are the ignorant architects: damned for us, we are smarter than we think. This virus spawned because of a need. It was the logical evolutionary step for humanity. It is what we (internally) desired... Evolution. Simply making efficient the lives we catty out The trivial distraction that is life, prevented us from noticing, the gradual change... Collectively, we longed for an amendment (to life). Easier... Simple... Apathetic. Uncultivated areas of our brain the silent nursery. Natural magnetic waves that circle out world, creating a linked community: Linking us all without awareness, nurturing the 'virus': the evolutionary solution. Continually developing. Continually refining, methodically approaching the required developed state. What happens now as out bodies lie still? A serene silence eclipsing the globe... Our next stage of evolution is complete... The human form more efficient than previously thought possible. But, how long can the hosts of our new way of life sustain us? Our mortal bodies... Without nutritional replenishment surely we perish? Is this an evolutionary flaw, of just a natural progression? "

Priceless currency, salvation for sale. A unique offer?! Who likes fairy tales? Instinct calls for destruction. Prayers will muffle their screams. Good Lord will drink this blood. Every divinity demands sacrifice. Every sacrifice needs divine purposes. This is blood mantra. A universal rite. Divided by symbols, possessed by laws Throats cut for power, Rebels choked on their blood Temples carved in red stone Altars from looted gold Sanctification by slaughter Absolution by doom Saviors impaled on their thrones The reaper's dancing around Vicious circle rolls on I see the cultures - fed by the same earth breast I see the races - watered by the same earth veins I see all the chosen nations - sharing the same breath (as me) I saw civilizations burnt - their blood soaked into this earth I saw gods raised from their ashes Under different names I saw devouring hate Driven by fear of otherness.

Screech and pop of this hollow shell would have provided escape for the fortunate. There were never signs of slowing down as it ripped right through me.
